With the infusion of different genres such as soul, folk and rock, Guthrie brings audiences together through brilliant lyrics and an expressive voice.<p>Most recently, Guthrie has been noted as “the guy from the Jennifer Hudson commercial.” The now-infamous American Family Insurance <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpdKo6JnQJA\" rel=\"nofollow\">commercial</a> features him playing in Atlanta’s Woodruff Park when the Grammy Award-Winning singer and performer Jennifer Hudson surprises Guthrie and sings along to Bill Wither’s beloved “Lovely Day.” The commercial has played on national television and radio, resulting in new opportunities and heightened awareness for Alex Guthrie, his band and his music.<p>Guthrie and his band have performed events including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRrPME6Qu50&feature=youtu.be\" rel=\"nofollow\">Milwaukee’s Summerfest</a> — which was also featured on <a href=\"http://www.jimmykimmellivemusic.com/videos/american-family-insurance-summerfest-recap-4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jimmy Kimmel Live! Music</a> — as well as the 30A Songwriter’s Festival in Florida, Wire and Wood Songwriter Festival in Alpharetta, GA, Jammin’ Java Listening Room in Vienna, VA, the Elbo Room in Chicago, IL and Eddie’s Attic in Atlanta, GA.<p>In the early stages of his career, Guthrie released his first album, <em>Lessons Learned, </em>and also scored the Atlanta Braves Band of the Year in 2014. In 2015, Guthrie and his band were awarded the Georgia Americana Artist of the Year — another astounding achievement bringing his music much-deserved attention and recognition. Within a short span of time, Guthrie was opening up for national touring artists including renowned BMLG Records recording Artist Drake White, RCA recording artist Bleachers, and famous Atlantic Records recording Artist Kelly Clarkson.<p>Singer-songwriter Alex Guthrie continues to impress and defy conventional expectations, making waves as he makes great music. A new album is currently being recorded and is expected to be released in Spring 2018.<p><p><a href=\"http://www.workplay.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_9283.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>Born in the Philippines, raised in New York, educated in California and now entertaining Birmingham, AL, is one of the hottest musicians rising out of the growing music scene. Lily has built a buzz beyond just Birmingham, and many of those who follow the local music scene mention her as one of those Birmingham gems that is poised to explode onto the national and international scene. Her music mixes R&B, jazz, pop, folk and funk with her superb songwriting talents. She has played venues all over the country and remains busy with an enormous following on newly the emerging streaming platform, Twitch, and YouTube. She is looking to release a new album this year, and has recently released a video for her single, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYYQNdhzxoQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tinder Love</a>”</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>",

The first place winner of the band competition will have their choice to headline the October Phelan Park finale or open up for Blues Ball in December. The second place winner will play the gig that the first place winner does not choose. The third place winner will play for the MCBS birthday party in January 2019. The solo/duo winner will have the option to open the October Phelan Park finale or other MCBS event.<br> Additionally, the MCBS will give a stipend to the winners to assist with the costs of attending the finals in Memphis.<br> Please note:<br> An act my only enter the IBC 3 times. They may not participate 3 consecutive years. A musician may not compete in the band category and the solo/duo in the same year. All members of a winning act must attend the IBC. Acts must enter the challenge of their own/home affiliate first. If they are not successful, they may enter the challenges of no more than 2 affiliates in that year provided those affiliates are within 250 miles of the home affiliate.<br> See here for full details of The Blues foundation Guidelines https://blues.org/international-blues-challenge/#_performers<br> RULES AND SCORING CRITERIA<br> IBC judges are Blues professionals and aficionados with a deep understanding and historical perspective of all blues forms. Any given judge panel will include members with varying opinions of Blues, covering the spectrum of Blues from the most traditional to soul/blues and rock/blues. <br> Scoring Categories and Definitions:<br> •Blues Content: The sound and feel of the music should be true to any of blues sub-categories: traditional blues, country blues, soul blues, blues rock and/or contemporary blues. Judges will be listening for inspired and original song selections or new takes on blues standards. Creative reach is encouraged.<br> •Originality: Original work is encouraged. Cover tunes are allowed but playing the recorded rendition lick by lick is discouraged, will not be looked upon favorably by the judges, and will be reflected in scoring.<br> Acts must indicate if their songs are their own original material (this can be done at the start of the set or before each song as appropriate) and/or identify the covers that they are playing and acknowledge the originator.<br> •Vocals: The act’s vocal skills to include concepts of tone, musicality, meaning, and expression.<br> •Instrumental Talent: Ability level on all instruments featured within the act.<br> •Stage Presence: The ability to command the attention of the audience by the impressiveness of one’s manner and appearance on stage. Judges will consider how an act connects with and engages the audience in the music. Proper use of microphones and amplification will be considered. <br> Basic Scoring Calculation:<br> Judges will score acts on a 10 point scale, with 10 points being the highest score received and 1 point being the lowest. The following weights will be used in calculating final scores:<br> •Raw scores for Blues Content will be multiplied by four<br> •Raw scores for Originality will be multiplied by three<br> •Raw scores for Talent and for Vocals will be multiplied by two<br> •Raw scores for Stage Presence will be multiplied by two<br> The maximum Total Weighted Score an act may receive is 130.<br> Penalty Points: <br> An act will be penalized one point from its Total Weighted Score for each of the following:<br> •Failing to acknowledge that a song is a cover and/or not giving credit to its originator<br> •Each ten seconds that it runs overtime during a competition performance.<br> •Finishing 3 or more minutes before its allotted performance time expires.<br> •Showing up late and/or missing Orientation<br> •Not being ready to perform at stated time<br> SCORING SYSTEM FOR JUDGES<br> Each judge will indicate his or her Raw Score, between 1 and 10, in each category and turn that information over to the Scorekeeper using the following scale:<br> •1-3 – Typical of a beginning blues band<br> •4-5 – Typical of a local weekend band<br> •6-7 – Typical of an advanced local band but not yet ready to headline a major blues club<br> •8-9 – Typical of the quality of blues artists who headline major clubs<br> •10 – Typical of those who play the main stage at major festivals<br> 1.The Scorekeeper will multiply the Raw Score in each category by the established multiplier to get each judge’s Individual Weighted Score in each category for each act.<br> 2.The Individual Weighted Scores for each category will be added together to determine each act’s Total Weighted Score for each judge.<br> 3.Any penalty points assigned will then be deducted from each judge’s Total Weighted Score to obtain the act’s Net Weighted Score for each judge.<br> 4.After all acts have been judged and each act’s Net Weighted Score per judge calculated, each act will be ranked by judge based on that judge’s order of scores, with the act receiving the judge’s highest Net Weighted Score being given a ranking of 1, and so on for that judge. This will reveal each acts Final Ranking Number for each judge.<br> 5.The Scorekeeper then will total the Final Ranking Number from all judges for each act to determine the Gross Final Ranking. This figure is averaged (divided by the total number of judges) to Achieve the Aggregate Act Ranking.<br> 6. The act with the best Aggregate Act Ranking will be the top finisher.<br> 7.In the case of a tie, the Scorekeeper shall calculate the sum of all Net Weighted Scores from all judges for the tied acts. The band with the higher sum of Net Weighted Scores wins.<br> Other Considerations <br> 1. Backline and Equipment<br> The MCBS will provide backline and sound. The setup on stage will include a drum kit with snare drums, amps, keyboards and mics. The backline in will be based on the act’s registration information. Drummers should bring their own cymbals and kick pedals. Harmonica players may (but are not required to) bring their own harp amp. Keyboard players are allowed (but are not required) to bring their own keyboard and keyboard amps. Keyboard stands will be provided. Effects racks and other auxiliary equipment are permitted. Musicians must include on the online registration form any additional or special equipment needed.<br> Competitors are prohibited from bringing their own guitar amplifiers (harp amps and keyboard amps being the only exceptions). Musicians should bring their own DI boxes. Every effort will be made to provide suitable equipment.<br><br>There are currently no videos. Check back soon.",

		"description": "Corey Smith, the fan-made man, has sold over 1 million concert tickets, 1.5 million digital singles and over 220,000 albums.  Smith has amassed an unfailingly devout fan base, not only in his native Southeast region, but all around the nation, simply by telling it the way it is.  He has released 10 albums—including 2011’s Top 20 release The Broken Record.  Corey has written every word on every album himself and he produced 9 out of 10 of the records. In Summer 2015, Corey teamed up with producer Keith Stegall (Alan Jackson, Zac Brown Band) for his album, “While the Gettin’ Is Good,” which was released on Sugar Hill Records.  Smith’s concerts, which were documented on his last live record, Live in Chattanooga, regularly sell out, with audiences singing along to such fan favorites as the coming-of-age anthem “Twenty-One,” the nostalgic time warp “If I Could Do It Again” and the group hug “I Love Everyone.”   Corey consistently tours, hitting around 120 dates per year and has begun releasing singles from his upcoming project, the Great Wide Underground.",

With the infusion of different genres such as soul, folk and rock, Guthrie brings audiences together through brilliant lyrics and an expressive voice.<p>Most recently, Guthrie has been noted as “the guy from the Jennifer Hudson commercial.” The now-infamous American Family Insurance <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpdKo6JnQJA\" rel=\"nofollow\">commercial</a> features him playing in Atlanta’s Woodruff Park when the Grammy Award-Winning singer and performer Jennifer Hudson surprises Guthrie and sings along to Bill Wither’s beloved “Lovely Day.” The commercial has played on national television and radio, resulting in new opportunities and heightened awareness for Alex Guthrie, his band and his music.<p>Guthrie and his band have performed events including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRrPME6Qu50&feature=youtu.be\" rel=\"nofollow\">Milwaukee’s Summerfest</a> — which was also featured on <a href=\"http://www.jimmykimmellivemusic.com/videos/american-family-insurance-summerfest-recap-4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jimmy Kimmel Live! Music</a> — as well as the 30A Songwriter’s Festival in Florida, Wire and Wood Songwriter Festival in Alpharetta, GA, Jammin’ Java Listening Room in Vienna, VA, the Elbo Room in Chicago, IL and Eddie’s Attic in Atlanta, GA.<p>In the early stages of his career, Guthrie released his first album, <em>Lessons Learned, </em>and also scored the Atlanta Braves Band of the Year in 2014. In 2015, Guthrie and his band were awarded the Georgia Americana Artist of the Year — another astounding achievement bringing his music much-deserved attention and recognition. Within a short span of time, Guthrie was opening up for national touring artists including renowned BMLG Records recording Artist Drake White, RCA recording artist Bleachers, and famous Atlantic Records recording Artist Kelly Clarkson.<p>Singer-songwriter Alex Guthrie continues to impress and defy conventional expectations, making waves as he makes great music. A new album is currently being recorded and is expected to be released in Spring 2018.<p><p><a href=\"http://www.workplay.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_9283.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>Born in the Philippines, raised in New York, educated in California and now entertaining Birmingham, AL, is one of the hottest musicians rising out of the growing music scene. Lily has built a buzz beyond just Birmingham, and many of those who follow the local music scene mention her as one of those Birmingham gems that is poised to explode onto the national and international scene. Her music mixes R&B, jazz, pop, folk and funk with her superb songwriting talents. She has played venues all over the country and remains busy with an enormous following on newly the emerging streaming platform, Twitch, and YouTube. She is looking to release a new album this year, and has recently released a video for her single, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYYQNdhzxoQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tinder Love</a>”</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>",

		"description": " with Abby Anderson, Presented by 102.5 The Bull<br> Russell Dickerson was born for the stage. Im just naturally that kind of dude: a big, loud and over-the-top guy, he says with a laugh. Yes, one of country musics most talked-about new talents -- and the voice behind the smash single Yours, a stunning ballad inspired by his wife of four years, Kailey, thats racked up over 33 million streams to date on Spotify, where hes been on the Hot Country, Country Gold Playlists and more for over a year, and exploded since being serviced to country radio in April -- need not go into entertainer mode before he catapults himself onstage to deliver one of his notoriously amped-up live shows.Hes already there.I go out there, and Im just me, Dickerson, who recently tore up arenas with Thomas Rhett and Kelsea Ballerini on the Home Team Tour, says. Watch the massive-voiced singer up there, whipping the crowd into hysterics and performing with that time-honored killer instinct. Hes running around and singing to people and messing with them and loving on them. Its about interacting the whole time. I want people screaming their faces off. Its all for the crowd.Even as a Union City, Tennessee-raised, obsessive teenage music fan, one whod regularly wait in wraparound lines to see his favorite artists perform in Nashville (I just got hooked on that energy) and held up Garth Brooks and Keith Urban DVDs as his personal Gospel, Dickerson, says being that dude onstage was always the dream. We would scream every word of every song, and all I could think about was I want to be that guy! Now, thanks to Yours and hook-heavy rockers like Blue Tacoma and MGNO, hes steadily built a serious fan base of his own.Strident, proud and fiercely determined in his artistry, Dickerson is that rare breed of artist who both writes with patient, staid intention and performs like a kid living out his wildest fantasy. Ive always envisioned myself playing stadiums. Honestly, as big as it will go, man, says the singer/songwriter who saw Yours explode on satellite radio and streaming services alike after Dickerson released his Billboard charting EP. The songs success led his manager at Dennis Entertainment to introduce him to the newly formed Triple Tigers, a joint venture with Sony Music, in October 2016 where he became the flagship artist.Now, with his forthcoming full-length debut album, Yours, Dickerson is gearing up for his most massive moment yet. Right now Im just so stoked on life so I wanted my record to mimic that, the 30-year-old says of a feel-good album stuffed with equal parts swagger (Billions, Float) and sweet vibes (All Fall Down, You Look Like A Love Song). We just kept rolling with it, he says of the loose, freewheeling writing sessions for the LP. To that end, if theres a palpable ease and whimsical flow to Dickersons melodies and lyrics its because hes found trusted collaborators, the most notable of which is his wife.It was Kailey, in fact, who not only inspired Yours but also dreamed up the idea for its stunning video. On a rainy day back in 2015, the Dickersons drove out near John C. Tune Airport and, with Russell strolling behind his car for what he thought was merely test footage, Kailey began filming. This spur-of-the-moment adventure that cost only the $6 required for gas money wound up producing the massively successful beautiful black-and-white music video for Dickersons breakout hit. To date, the video for Yours has been viewed more than three million times on YouTube. Its experiences like this, not to mention a fruitful writing partnership with longtime friends and fellow Belmont University graduates Parker Welling and Casey Brown, that has Dickerson feeling so inspired. Were just young kids writing relevant music, he says. And having all known each other for years, as well as seeing Russell and Kaileys relationship blossom, the trio all felt connected to Yours. Since then, theyve teamed to write the majority of the songs on his upcoming album as well. Its just cool to write with friends, Dickerson says. Its way less pressure and I can be myself. We just have this deeper connection.Its a feeling not dissimilar from one hes long held for music on the whole. The son of a piano-teaching mother and church choir-leading father, Dickerson was constantly surrounded by songs as a child. It was all around me, he remembers of an idyllic childhood. Dickerson credits discovering classic country artists like George Jones and Jim Reeves later in life as inspiring him to eventually pursue a career as a country music singer/songwriter. By the time he enrolled at Belmont and fell in with a group of hungry young musicians, he knew hed found his calling. It was really natural and young and innocent and we were having fun making music, he recalls.Dickerson says hed written hundreds of songs before that gut feeling kicked in one day in 2014 when he, Welling and Brown penned Yours. When we wrote it we all said This is amazing! And then it was just one thing after another, he says of the songs rocketship ride to radio. To get that affirmation from everyone at, what felt like, every step publishers, record label, radio is just so incredible. Adds Dickerson of the breakout song, which has become a wedding standard, and because of which he recorded an acoustic wedding version: Its such a boost of confidence. Its validation.Still, even as the accomplishments pile up, including the distinct honor of playing at the Grand Ole Opry last June (To be recognized for my craft by an establishment thats so esteemed in the industry was emotional), Dickerson remains steadfast in his pursuit of refining his craft and taking his career to new heights.For as long as weve prepped for this, Dickerson says, I hope this is just the beginning.",

		"description": " <br> &quot;The road goes on forever ...&quot;It&#39;s not always easy to sum up a career - let alone a life&#39;s ambition - so succinctly, but those five words from Robert Earl Keen&#39;s calling-card anthem just about do it. You can complete the lyric with the next five words - the ones routinely shouted back at Keen by thousands of fans a night (&quot;and the party never ends!&quot;) - just to punctuate the point with a flourish, but it&#39;s the part about the journey that gets right to the heart of what makes Keen tick. Some people take up a life of playing music with the goal of someday reaching a destination of fame and fortune; but from the get-go, Keen just wanted to write and sing his own songs, and to keep writing and singing them for as long as possible.&quot;I always thought that I wanted to play music, and I always knew that you had to get some recognition in order to continue to play music,&quot; Keen says. &quot;But I never thought of it in terms of getting to be a big star. I thought of it in terms of having a really, really good career and writing some good songs, and getting onstage and having a really good time.&quot;Now three-decades on from the release of his debut album - with eighteen other records to his name, thousands of shows under his belt and still no end in sight to the road ahead - Keen remains as committed to and inspired by his muse as ever. And as for accruing recognition, well, he&#39;s done alright on that front, too; from his humble beginnings on the Texas folk scene, he&#39;s blazed a peer, critic, and fan-lauded trail that&#39;s earned him living-legend (not to mention pioneer) status in the Americana music world. And though the Houston native has never worn his Texas heart on his sleeve, he&#39;s long been regarded as one of the Lone Star State&#39;s finest (not to mention top-drawing) true singer-songwriters. He was still a relative unknown in 1989 when his third studio album, West Textures, was released - especially on the triple bill he shared at the time touring with legends Townes Van Zandt and Guy Clark - but once fellow Texas icon Joe Ely recorded both &quot;The Road Goes on Forever&quot; and &quot;Whenever Kindness Fails&quot; on his 1993 album, Love and Danger, the secret was out on Keen&#39;s credentials as a songwriter&#39;s songwriter. By the end of the decade, Keen was a veritable household name in Texas, headlining a millennial New Year&#39;s Eve celebration in Austin that drew an estimated 200,000 people. A dozen years later, he was inducted into the Texas Heritage Songwriters Hall of Fame along with the late, great Van Zandt and his longtime friend from Texas A & M, Lyle Lovett.The middle child of a geologist father and an attorney mother, Keen was weaned on classic rock (in particular, the psychedelic blues trio Cream) and his older brother&#39;s Willie Nelson records - but it was his younger sister&#39;s downtown Houston celebrity status as a &quot;world-champion foosball player&quot; that exposed him to the area&#39;s acoustic folk scene. By the time he started working on his English degree at Texas A&M, he was teaching himself guitar and setting his poetic musings to song. That in turn led to a college fling with a bluegrass ensemble (featuring his childhood friend Bryan Duckworth, who would continue to play fiddle with Keen well into the &#39;90s) and front-porch picking parties with fellow Aggie Lovett at Keen&#39;s rental house - salad days captured in spirit on the Keen/Lovett co-write, &quot;The Front Porch Song,&quot; which both artists would eventually record on their respective debut albums.While Lovett&#39;s self-titled debut was released on major-label Curb Records, Keen took the road less travelled, self-financing and producing 1984&#39;s No Kinda Dancer and leasing it to the independent label Rounder Records, which issued it on its Philo imprint. &quot;It was difficult, because I didn&#39;t know what I was doing ... I literally opened up the phonebook and looked for studios,&quot; Keen recalls. &quot;I basically put it all together through brute force and ignorance, but I was shocked with how well it worked out and very happy with it. We had a release party at Butch Hancock&#39;s Dixie Bar and Bustop, and Lyle and Nanci Griffith and a lot of those people who were a part of the Austin folkie scene came out.&quot;Keen himself had already started to make quite a name for himself on that scene, thanks to four years of constant regional gigging and winning the Kerrville Folk Festival&#39;s prestigious New Folk songwriting competition in 1983. After his debut&#39;s release, he began touring more and more outside of the state lines, eventually moving to Nashville in 1986. Keen&#39;s stint in Music City, U.S.A., lasted just under two years, but he returned to Texas armed with a publishing deal, a new label (another indie, Sugar Hill), and a national booking agent. He closed the decade with 1988&#39;s The Live Album and the following year&#39;s West Textures, the album that marked the debut of &quot;The Road Goes on Forever&quot; and, not inconsequently, kicked his career into high gear.With hindsight, Keen admits he no idea at the time of writing it that his song about a couple of ill-fated lovers running afoul of the law would have the legs it did, but he readily points to the forward thinking of DJ Steve Coffman of San Antonio radio station KRIO for helping to start the fire. &quot;He talked the station into doing sort of a free-form programing format, basically anything he liked, which turned out to be some Texas music along with a lot of cool sort of pop music,&quot; he says. &quot;So all of a sudden, I heard my song back-to-back with the Sheryl Crow song that was popular at the time, and that was the first time that I really felt like I was a real part of the music business, despite having been in it already for a pretty long time. And right after that, I went to a show in San Antonio and there were 1,500 people there - whereas up to that point I&#39;d been playing to, max, maybe 150. That was the real ah-hah moment for me that really got me going and kept me going, because before that I&#39;d been doing this for eight or 10 years and had a lot of rejection but very little success.&quot;After that, though, success came in spades. Although he continued to steer clear of the Garth Brooks-dominated waters of the country mainstream, the perfect storm of Keen&#39;s literate song craft, razor wit and killer band (more on that in a bit) stirred up a grassroots sensation in Texas not seen since the &#39;70s heyday of maverick &quot;outlaw country&quot; upstarts Willie, Waylon, and Jerry Jeff Walker. Armed with two more albums (1993&#39;s A Bigger Piece of Sky and &#39;94&#39;s Gringo Honeymoon) brimming with instant classics like &quot;Corpus Christi Bay,&quot; &quot;Whenever Kindness Fails,&quot; &quot;Gringo Honeymoon,&quot; &quot;Dreadful Selfish Crime&quot; and &quot;Merry Christmas From the Family,&quot; he began packing dancehalls, roadhouses, theaters, and festival grounds with diverse crowds of rowdy college kids, serious singer-songwriter fans and plenty of folks who, like Keen himself, had been around the Texas music scene long enough to remember Willie&#39;s earliest 4th of July Picnics. And the phenomenon was not confined to the Texas state lines. Famed producer and pedal steel ace Lloyd Maines (Joe Ely, Terry Allen) helped Keen and his band bottle lighting on 1996&#39;s No. 2 Live Dinner, a next-best-thing-to-being-there concert document that remains one of Keen&#39;s best-selling albums, and the burgeoning Americana music scene (bolstered by AAA radio stations across the country and magazines like No Depression) embraced Keen as one of its prime movers. In the wake of albums like 1997&#39;s Picnic and &#39;98&#39;s Walking Distance (both released on major-label Arista), one would have been hard-pressed to tell the difference between a rabid Robert Earl Keen crowd at Texas&#39; legendary Gruene Hall and those at New York City joints like Tramps and the Bowery Ballroom. Little wonder, then, that when the songwriter-revering &quot;Americana&quot; style was officially recognized by the industry 1998, Keen was the genre&#39;s first artist to be featured on the cover of the radio trade magazine Gavin.The &#39;90s may have been a boom period for Keen, but his momentum hasn&#39;t ebbed a bit since the turn of the century - nor has his pursuit of continued growth as a writer and artist. If anything, his output from the last decade has been marked by some of the most adventurous music of his career. &quot;Wild Wind,&quot; an unforgettable highlight from Gravitational Forces, his Gurf Morlix-produced 2001 debut for the Nashville-based Americana label Lost Highway, captured the character (and characters) of a small Texas town with a cinematic eye reminiscent of The Last Picture Show; but the album&#39;s title track also found Keen wryly experimenting with spacey, beatnik jazz. For the freewheelin&#39;, freak-flag-flying Farm Fresh Onions (2003, Audium/Koch), Keen and producer Rich Brotherton (his longtime guitarist) took the band into the proverbial garage to knock out their most rocking set of songs to date - most notably the psychedelic rave-up of the title track. Brotherton also produced the more rootsy but equally playful What I Really Mean (2005, E1 Music), but Lloyd Maines was back at the helm for 2009&#39;s eclectic The Rose Hotel and 2011&#39;s spirited Ready for Confetti (both released by Lost Highway). The later was especially well received by fans and critics alike, with AllMusic&#39;s Thom Jurek raving, &quot;Ready for Confetti is, without question, Keen&#39;s most inspired and focused project in nearly 20 years.&quot; His latest project released in 2015, &quot;Happy Prisoner: The Bluegrass Sessions&quot; was a straight -ahead &quot;love postcard to bluegrass&quot;. This was something Keen had wanted to do for a long time and it was now or never. Keen is ranked Billboard&#39;s No. 2, 2015 Bluegrass Artist of the year. His current recording, Happy Prisoner: The Bluegrass Sessions, charted as 2015&#39;s Top 5 album at Americana Radio and Billboard&#39;s 2015 No. 2 album on the Bluegrass Albums chart.Earlier this year, Keen played three weeks of sold-out theater dates with Lyle Lovett, just two longtime college friends swapping songs on acoustic guitars like they used to do on Keen&#39;s front porch in College Station. But the lion&#39;s share of his concert schedule still finds him playing full-tilt with his seasoned road and studio band: Brotherton on guitar, Bill Whitbeck on bass, Tom Van Schaik on drums, and Marty Muse on steel guitar. &quot;I&#39;ve been with this band for 20 years now,&quot; Keen says proudly. &quot;I used to think that was just sort of an interesting fact, but now it&#39;s almost a total anomaly - that just doesn&#39;t happen much. I always felt like once you lock into the right bunch of people, you try to do the best by them that you can. So we&#39;ve been able to stay together a long time, and I think one thing that makes it worthwhile for people to come see us as an act is the fact that it&#39;s not like we&#39;re trying to work it all out onstage - we&#39;ve already worked everything out.&quot;REK has had the honor of working with music legends Dave Matthews, Bonnie Raitt, Sheryl Crow, Eric Church, Gary Clark, Jr. among others. He was inducted into the Texas Heritage Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2012. In March 2015, Robert Earl Keen was recognized as the first recipient of BMI&#39;s official Troubadour Award. Keen is an active member of NARAS and was invited to be a participant in the prestigious &quot;Grammys On The Hill&quot; where he sang the National Anthem at the opening ceremony and was a member of the delegation that lobbied US Congress to support musicians&#39; rights, specifically the &quot;Fair Pay for Fair Play Act&quot;.But the road goes on and on, with no time for resting on laurels. Not that Keen&#39;s complaining. &quot;I had a relatively open schedule for 2016 back at the beginning of the year, but it has just filled in like you wouldn&#39;t believe,&quot; he marvels during a rare day off in Kerrville, Texas (where he lives with his wife and two daughters). &quot;I&#39;ve broke my record this year - I&#39;ve packed for five trips at one time, because I wasn&#39;t going to be starting any of them in the same place. It&#39;s been crazy!It isn&#39;t always easy being Robert Earl Keen, but somebody&#39;s got to do it. And now more than ever, he&#39;s up to the task and loving every minute of it.",

		"description": " with Travis Meadows<br> In the lush tobacco fields of North Carolina where BJ Barham was raised, people work hard. Families stay nearby, toiling and growing together. BJ loves those farms and his tiny Reidsville hometown, but he had to run off and start American Aquarium, a band now beloved by thousands. BJ couldnt stay. But he couldnt really leave, either: hes still singing about the lessons, stories, and lives that define rural Americaand him.I moved to the big city to go to college and fell in love with music, BJ says. But half the songs on our record are about small townslittle pieces of my childhood. Ive had moments where it turns out a piece of broken English my father repeated twice a week is the most accurate way to say something. So I put it in a song.American Aquariums seventh studio album Things Change offers the bands finest collection of folk-infused Southern rock-and-roll to date. Stacked with BJs signature storytellingalways deeply personal but also instantly relatablethe record questions and curses current events, shares one mans intimate evolution, and leaves listeners with a priceless gift: hope. In my early 20s, I was not as hopeful, BJ says. Now, as Im getting ready to become a father, I think I have to be hopefulespecially with the situation our country is in now. For her sake, I have to be positive. He pauses. Her is his daughter, due in the spring of 2018. BJ adds, Being self-aware has always been a blessing and a curse. But thats whats always made my songwriting relatable to people. I dont hold back. Im almost too honest.BJs candor has fueled American Aquariums runaway appeal, visible most clearly in consistently sold-out shows across the country and throughout Europe - between 200 and 250 dates a year. Much has changed for the band and BJ since their acclaimed last effort, Wolves. In 2017, every American Aquarium member save BJ quit the group. American Aquarium has featured about 30 players since BJ founded the outfit in 2006, and while each member has left indelible marks, the band has always been anchored by the literary songs and sometimes roaring, sometimes whispering, drawl of BJ Barham. BJs personal life also underwent seismic shifts: He got sober. He got married. Soon, hell be a dad.Featuring a new band lineup that includes Shane Boeker on lead guitar, drummer Joey Bybee, bassist Ben Hussey, and Adam Kurtz on pedal steel and electric guitar, as well as a reinvigorated frontman in BJ, Things Change is American Aquariums first release on a label after selling thousands of records on their own. As an artist, your goal is for the newest thing you do to be better than the last. Youre slowly whittling away the bullshit to try and get to the truth, BJ says. With this album, I learned how to cut some of that fat so that its just truth. Its our best record.Recorded at 3CG Records in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Things Change was produced by Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter John Fulbright and features cameos from Americana standouts including John Moreland and Jamie Lin Wilson. Brazen album opener The World is on Fire is a richly layered rock-and-roll anthem that documents BJ and his wifes stunned reaction to the last presidential election. Emotional and conversational, the song taps into widespread feelings of confusion and fear: She said, What are we going to do? Whats this world coming to? / For the first time in my whole life, I stood there speechless. But what begins as despair builds into defiant faith, as BJ growls a call to action to cap off one of his favorite songs hes ever written. Im complaining about the state of things, and then the third verse almost serves as a challenge to myself: hey, youre in charge of another human being. You can create change, he says.Driving rock-and-roller Crooked + Straight explores the small-town consequences of questioning religion, and the tightness of family in the face of one members rejection. His fathers advice anchors the song. I come from a blue-collar family. Im the only one who didnt go into farming. I learned if you want something, you have to go out and take it. You cant expect anything from anybody, BJ says. You can only go out there and work harder. My dad always said you can outwork anybody else. Love for hard work and the people who carry it out appears repeatedly throughout Things Change. Guitar-heavy Tough Folks is a snarling ode to those with dirt under their fingernails, while bass- and pedal-steel-infused Work Conquers All spins a tale in praise and pursuit of Oklahomas state motto.The albums love songs are the kind of achingly beautiful that only comes with maturity and a willingness to expose ones own flaws. Haunting Shadows of You recalls a lovers flight as the protagonist longs for what he let get away. Gorgeous Till the Final Curtain Falls celebrates loyalty and pledges endless devotion. The moving title track takes an often doleful topicpeoples tendency to changeand turns it on its head, tracing BJs personal growth and recognizing his now-wifes steadfast love. BJs other two favorite tracks are album standouts. Moving When We Were Younger Men addresses the break-up of American Aquarium head on. As BJ professes love for his former bandmates over stripped down acoustic guitar, his voice is honeyed and deep. Its an open letter to five guys who I spent eight years of my life with seeing the entire world, BJ says. I think anyone who has ever had to walk away from a friendship or has had somebody walk away from them will relate to the song. Stunner One Day at a Time is self-perceptive and vulnerable, detailing BJs battles with himself. Even within his career full of well-written gems, the song is a towering accomplishment.At the end of the day, if youre not writing songs to affect other peoples lives, youre in it for the wrong reasons, BJ says, reflecting on the new album, where hes been, and where American Aquarium is headed. Money may come and go. You may never get fame. But if you sit down and write songs to affect people, you can do it your whole life and be happy.",

		"description": " <br> Is it premature to see Hall of Fame material in a guy who&#39;s just releasing his first album?Not if that guy is Tony Jackson.To put it plainly, Jackson is one of the most gifted singers ever to grace country music.His initial videos from the album have excited over 25 Million Facebook views seemingly overnight, while Jackson tours tirelessly in support of the record.The respect Jackson has already earned within the music community is evident throughout Tony Jackson, as the new album is titled. It features songs and/or performances by Rock and Roll Hall of Fame members John Sebastian, Steve Cropper and Dr. John Mac Rebennack, Country Music Hall of Famers Vince Gill, Bill Anderson and Conway Twitty and Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame luminary Norro Wilson.It is the ease with which Jackson makes every songeven the familiar onesdistinctly his own that sets him apart. Who else would dare to try and then succeed in bringing a fresh layer of emotional urgency to such a classic as George Jones&#39; The Grand Tour or Conway Twitty&#39;s eternal It&#39;s Only Make Believe?On the first-time and lesser known songs, Jackson mints his own classics. With its sweeping steel guitar flourishes and ambient barroom clatter, he transforms John Sebastian and Phil Galdston&#39;s Last Call into the sweetest, most affectionate separation ballad imaginable. With reverence and a twinkle in his eye, he enlists Sebastian and Vince Gill in revivifying (after 50 years) the Lovin&#39; Spoonful&#39;s 1966 romp, Nashville Cats. When asked if we should recut the song, Sebastian begins, I said absolutely but we have to get Vince Gill, Paul Franklin and todays real Nashville Cats in on the session and fortunately it was preserved on video, he beams.After capturing perfectly, the excitement of new love in Bill Anderson&#39;s I Didn&#39;t Wake Up This Morning, he moves on to a memory-stirring homage to Merle Haggard, Hank Williams Jr. and Willie Nelson in They Lived It Up, a lyrical scrapbook from Anderson and Bobby Tomberlin.Jackson shines as a keen-eyed songwriter in his own right with such memorable excursions as Drink By Drink, Old Porch Swing, and She&#39;s Taking Me Home.From start to finish, Tony Jackson stands out as a discovery album, the kind you listen to with such delight that you have to recommend it to friends. And hundreds of thousands have done just that.Jackson is currently a headliner on the Old Dominion Barn Dance in Richmond, Virginia, and is almost certainly the only major bank executive ever to abandon a prominent IT job in finance at a Fortune 500 company to embark on a career in country music. But he didn&#39;t grow up a country fan.The son of a Navy man, he led a base-to-base existence, at one point living with his family in Rota, Spain for three years. His early musical background was sketchy at best. I sang &#39;White Christmas&#39; in the Christmas play in the sixth grade, he recalls. Everybody seemed to love it, but I was a wreck. My mother forced me to sing in the church choir, but I was kind of buried in the voices along with everybody else. This was basically his entire musical resume until ten or so years ago when a friend whose band had lost its lead singer asked Jackson to try out for the spot. I did, he says, and I was hooked after that.Two weeks after graduating from high school, Jackson joined the Marines. I told my dad I was joining because I was sick of taking orders, he says with a wry grin. There was as much getting-ahead as gung-ho in Jacksons enlistment. I was a computer and electronics geek as a teenager, he says. When I talked to the recruiter, he told me the Marine Corps had just started a computer science school in Quantico, Virginia. Fortunately, I scored high enough on the entrance exam to go to that school. It was a smart move. When he finished service, a prominent bank in Richmond snapped him up to work in its Information Technology division, initially assigning him the lowly chore of re-setting passwords. I was way overqualified, he says, so I got promoted fast. I was a senior vice president by my early 30s.It was while in the Marines that he first started paying serious attention to country music. My mother listened only to gospel, he says. My dad was into jazz, hip hop, R&B, new jack swingstuff like that, but Armed Forces Radio played everything. When I was living in Spainwhen I was 10 to 13Randy Travis came over there on a USO tour. Some friends and I were out there early when they were setting up the stage, and we actually got to talk to him before we realized he was the guy whod be performing later. He was really cool to us. In the Marine Corps, when my friends and I played music for each other, we were all homesick. So when youd listen to these country songs that talked about family and home and heartbreak, it would really grab you.A song that particularly appealed to Jackson was George Jones heartbreaking 1974 hit, The Grand Tour. When Jones died, Jackson and some friends went into a Richmond studio and recorded it. In the process, they also made a performance video that eventually wound up on YouTube. By sheer accident, singer Donna Dean Stevens saw the video and instantly decided Jackson should do The Grand Tour on the Old Dominion Barn Dance, which she had just resurrected. After she witnessed Jacksons standing ovationan honor that hadnt yet been accorded to any of the shows headlinersshe offered to co-manage and co-produce him with noted talent manager Jim Della Croce. A commanding performer in her own right, Dean Stevens recorded for Mercury Records in Nashville as Donna Meade. She is also the widow of Country Music Hall of Fame member Jimmy Dean and a zealous guardian of his vast musical legacy.Dean Stevens and Della Croce then whisked Jackson to Nashville, where he recorded most of Tony Jackson at the hallowed RCA Records Studios. In one of his best-loved songs, George Jones considered the dwindling ranks of country superstars and asked plaintively Who&#39;s Gonna Fill Their Shoes.Tony Jackson volunteering for duty.",

		"description": " with Cory Branan<br> Amanda Shires is not an entertainer. She isnt looking to help listeners escape their everyday lives or soundtrack celebrations. She isnt reaching for celebrity, and she isnt concerned with cultivating a personal brand. She is an artist in the true sense of the word, meaning she creates because she has a real need for the process of creating. That is not to say that the songs on My Piece Of Landarent entertaining, but that quality is a by-product. The real intention here is to relate. Ms. Shires began her career as a teenager playing fiddle with the Texas Playboys. Since then, shes toured and recorded with John Prine, Billy Joe Shaver, Todd Snider, Justin Townes Earle, Shovels & Rope, and most recently her husband Jason Isbell. Along the way shes made three solo albums, each serving to document a particular period in her life while improving on the perceptive qualities of the previous record. The songs on My Piece Of Land deal with family, with anxiety, with the phases of one young womans life; but the primary focus of My Piece Of Landis the concept of home. Ms. Shires addresses the similarities and differences between the home she was born into, the two homes she was eventually split between, and the home she has finally made for herself. Some of these stories are from the creators point of view and some most certainly are not. Youd be hard-pressed to identify which is which, though, considering the level of empathy involved in the creation of these stories. The concept of home, like the concept of love, is more complex than it seems, says Ms. Shires. You start out with this inherited idea of home, but as you grow you realize thats only a suggestion. You have to use that along with all the little pieces of wisdom youve picked up along the way to finally build your own place in the world. Ms. Shires sometimes describes songwriting as solving the puzzles, but before the songwriter even begins to arrange rhymes and melodies, she must first be acquainted with the complicated workings of the heart. Most of this album was written after Ms. Shires had reached the seven-month point in a summertime pregnancy, and was no longer able to travel. For a woman used to touring most of the year, being stuck inside brought challenges and offered creative rewards. Pregnancy does weird things to you, Amanda says. You walk around holding your arms over your belly, sometimes almost overcome by anxiety. I constantly wondered if I would be able to protect this child, if my marriage would last forever, if Id learned enough about the world to be a good mother. At the same time, youre so excited, so hopeful, and so severely physically limited. About how the setting affected the finished product, she says This record turned out to be a personal record, set in our home where I had lots of time for reflection and time to face my concerns and fears. The listener can hear Ms. Shires unpacking those anxieties in a song like Slippin, with its ruminations on what could go wrong in a relationship that seems stable. Therell be a trigger,then up starts the fire,a handful of matchessome faulty wiring.Youll say you have this hollow feeling. Somethings always been missing. Tonight could be the night you go slippin&#39; away from me. Her piece of land is one with a panoramic view, and she pays close attention to even the smallest details. Take, for instance, the first stanza of Harmless. A phased golden light rained down from the streetlight. It fell across your shoulder, paused just above your collar. With this description of one fleeting moment, the writer sets an entire scene. Ms. Shireswould argue that the term poet should not be used to mean unusually perceptive songwriter, since the roles of modern songwriter and poet are so very different. However, it isnt hard to understand how her post-graduate education in poetry helps Ms. Shires choose which details to include. Its all about precision. My time in the MFA (Master Of Fine Arts) program at Sewanee taught me a lot about different ways of writing and how they all have one thing in common: the better you are at editing, the better your work will be. Spending long hours workshopping poems and reading the classics gave me a solid standard when it came time to edit my songs. Ms. Shires recorded My Piece Of Land under the guidance of brilliant Nashville producer Dave Cobb at his Low Country Sound studio. Inviting Cobb to produceMy Piece Of Landwas an easy decision to make, considering Ms. Shires had worked with him before on Jason Isbell&#39;s albums Southeastern and Something More Than Free. Ms. Shires knew of Daves propensity toward arranging the songs in-studio, rather than rehearsing or making demos beforehand. Cobb believes in the spontaneity of early takes, and with the proficient rhythm section of Paul Slivka and Paul Griffith, the studio band was able to record the album in a relatively short amount of time without sacrificing performance quality. This approach gives each song on the album emotional urgency along with a groove thats loose and effortless. Among other things, Pale Fire is about consciously shifting ones own priorities. There are two types of lovers: the kind we need and the kind we want. The hard part is finding someone who represents both. You Are My Home is written as a gift, a token of appreciation to someone who has helped the narrator define her place in the world. Mineral Wells is a song Ms. Shires wrote many years ago, after relocating to Nashville from her childhood home in Texas. It speaks to the part of us that never really leaves that original homeplace. With My Piece Of Land, you get the sense that Amanda Shires has reached a personal pinnacle. This album is the creative milestone suited to accompany the recent milestones in her life: becoming a mother, developing into a true artist, and finally finding a home.",

		"description": " <br> Five years have passed since Case&#39;s last solo project, The Worse Things Get, the Harder I Fight, the Harder I Fight, the More I Love You. In the interim, she sang on Whiteout Conditions, the 2017 release from longtime bandmates the New Pornographers. The year before that, she released a vinyl box set of her solo work and joined k.d. Lang and Laura Veirs on the case/lang/veirs project.Recording that record was a revelation, from Veirs&#39; innovative guitar tunings to Lang&#39;s skills in studio. &quot;I learned so much experiencing the work ethic of those two,&quot; Case says. She considers Lang &quot;probably the most natural producer I&#39;ve ever seen. Watching her work was awe-inspiring.&quot;After their national tour together, Case found similar transcendence in October 2016 sitting on a panel at the first-of-its-kind &quot;Woman Producer&quot; summit in Brooklyn, NY. Between discussions and performances from a diverse group of women who produce music from around the world, she wondered how it had taken such a long time to get to that moment, and why so many female pioneers had been forgotten.She felt lucky to have worked with the people she had encountered across her career-Darryl Neudorf, Tucker Martine, Craig Schumacher, and Chris Schultz among them-who encouraged her to expand her own skills in studio. But she had also gotten fed up with a world in which women&#39;s accomplishments seemed to vanish from public memory. &quot;The George Martins and Quincy Joneses of the recording pantheon deserve every drop of praise and every project they have received,&quot; Case says. &quot;But we can&#39;t keep telling the same stories over and over. We need more stories, more inspiration, more flavors.&quot;She set to work on her next record looking for not just new stories but also new sounds. This time, she wanted to put herself in a setting far away from everything she knew. She recalled Bjrn Yttling&#39;s skill with Lykke Li, Camera Obscura, and his own band, Peter Bjorn and John. &quot;I&#39;ve worked with the same people so long, I never had to step outside my comfort zone,&quot; Case says. &quot;In this instance, I chose to.&quot;The two met over breakfast in Washington, DC, and decided to team up. By the time she went to Sweden in the fall of 2017, Case had already written songs with longtime collaborator Paul Rigby, laid down vocal and guitar tracks at WaveLab Studio in Tucson, and built Carnacial Singing, her recording space in Vermont.But in the middle of her stint in Stockholm, with the finish line in sight, she received a surreal 3am call telling her that her house was burning and would likely be completely destroyed. She felt panicked and helpless.The fire had started in the barn, where she kept an assortment of belongings, from artwork to old pianos. A friend had managed to get the dogs to safety. After the flames jumped to the house, her home was engulfed, too.A few hours later, she went into a studio in Stockholm and laid down the vocals for &quot;Bad Luck,&quot; singing the lines she had written long before she realized they would land on her.Case is now stoic about the fire. &quot;If somebody burned your house down on purpose, you&#39;d feel so violated. But when nature burns your house down, you can&#39;t take it personally.&quot; The month before the blaze, Hurricane Harvey had slammed into Texas and flooded Houston. Her home burned just as Puerto Rico was plunged into a nightmare by Hurricane Maria and wildfires incinerated California. &quot;In the big picture, my house burning was so unimportant,&quot; she says. &quot;So many people lost so much more: lives and lives and lives.&quot;She was hell-bent on not losing sight of the goal, reminding herself there was still beauty in the world and in the process of making music. She had been reading a lot of ancient history, including Adrienne Mayor&#39;s The Amazons, and thinking about how for millennia, women have been more central to events than the average history class admits. &quot;We were always there, we were just erased. And I knew it. As a little girl I knew it. As a young person I knew it,&quot; Case says. &quot;Now I know it anew with a ferocious, righteous, razor-sharp tribe of witnesses, and it makes me feel like a super-powerful human being. It makes me feel joy. There&#39;s an inheritance there that&#39;s really important, and I want to share it.&quot;She decided to climb inside her role as producer and wield it more directly. It just meant owning what she was already doing.***The record that came out of this reckoning with lost stories delivers both familiar Neko Case and something different. Death, extinction, exploitation, tides, animals, and adoration all blend recognizably. Case&#39;s trademark narrative gaps, just large enough for listeners to enter each song, likewise remain. As with Fox Confessor Brings the Flood and Middle Cyclone, Hell-On spins away from conventions of story, slipping into real life, with its fierce mess and blind catastrophes.&quot;I&#39;m writing fairy tales, and I hear my life story in them, but they&#39;re not about me,&quot; Case says. &quot;I still can&#39;t figure out how to describe it. But I think that&#39;s why we make music or write things. You&#39;ve got to invent a new language.&quot;There are differences, too. The opening kalimba notes of the first track, &quot;Hell On,&quot; lead into a waltz of deep forces, irresistible as gravity, that refuse to be leashed or controlled (&quot;You&#39;ll not be my master / you&#39;re barely my guest&quot;). This tornado might not love you.Case planned this record with a commitment to big choruses and a goal of making them even bigger. The results appear in the anthemic &quot;Last Lion of Albion,&quot; a requiem for every landscape and iconic creature (&quot;last tiger of Tasmania / the last she-wolf to suckle Rome&quot;) erased through massacre and marketing. Rounding out the opening trilogy of false possession is &quot;Halls of Sarah,&quot; a song for unwilling muses tormented by poets who love women &quot;as lions love Christians.&quot;&quot;Bad Luck,&quot; recorded from the ground up in Stockholm, opens at a gallop and never breaks stride. A song always poses the challenge of when to move away from the groove and how to get back to it. But Yttling pointed out to Case that sometimes the whole song should be the hook-that there&#39;s no shame in exploiting the catchiest part. That became the strategy for bringing &quot;Bad Luck&quot; to life. Longtime collaborators Kelly Hogan and Nora O&#39;Connor came up with backing vocals that build a giddy, knowing call and response into the song.For &quot;The Curse of the I-5 Corridor,&quot; former Screaming Trees frontman Mark Lanegan duets with Case on a ballad of memory and departure. Melancholy grooves &quot;Gumball Blue&quot; and &quot;My Uncle&#39;s Navy&quot; mark Case&#39;s first songwriting efforts with New Pornographers cofounder Carl Newman. And after performing it live for years, Case has finally done a studio recording with Eric Bachmann of his song &quot;Sleep All Summer,&quot; which moved her to pull over to the side of the road and cry the first time she heard it on the radio.The labyrinthine &quot;Dirty Diamond&quot; opens onto room after room of shifting vocals that soar above a march-like rhythm. &quot;Oracle of the Maritimes,&quot; perhaps the most fairy tale song on the record, floats over a tuning invented by co-writer Laura Veirs, carrying a love that longs to prove itself (&quot;come on sweet girl let&#39;s find you an ocean / that goes with your eyes&quot;).Clouds of mosquitoes rising out of hot tires, a chest of drawers that rides out into the waves, a box filled with unnamed newborn creatures: these songs are bursting with images that can only be understood through peripheral vision, shards of imaginary lives wired into a mosaic.Later comes &quot;Winnie,&quot; a pirate love song for a woman with a mouth &quot;as sharp as the rib of a star.&quot; The song came from the afterglow of reading Amazons. &quot;There aren&#39;t enough songs that are obviously about a woman loving another woman, just loving her, Sapphic or Platonic,&quot; Case says. &quot;I thought there should be one, because I know I sit around loving them all day.&quot;The record ends with &quot;Pitch or Honey,&quot; winding its way through intimate verses sung over a drum machine before blooming into layered vocals, a bigger beat, and a wall of sound. &quot;Am I making pitch or honey?&quot; fades into repetition of &quot;I love you better when you&#39;re wild.&quot;The record was born at the hands of some three dozen performers in all, from k.d. Lang, Laura Veirs, Beth Ditto, and Robert Forster on backing vocals, to Joey Burns of Calexico and Doug Gillard of Guided by Voices on guitars, and Barbara Gruska and Matt Chamberlain on drums. The sidelong perspective is part of the known Neko galaxy, but the production is more expansive and edgier, moving into new universes. These are songs that can swallow you.***When Case returned to the US and walked through the ruins of her home, the fire that had blazed after these songs were written became part of the record. For the cover, she made a warrior&#39;s helmet out of cigarettes. Interior and exterior shots of her incinerated house appear on the gatefold and booklet. And a tiny pop-open charred Brothers-Grimm cottage serves as the set for the video of &quot;Bad Luck.&quot;It was as if nature invented a landscape for Hell-On after the fact: a melted ladder, seared insulation dangling in ribbons, the internal organs of pianos. She thought it should all be included in solidarity with those who had lost so much in the past year.All the living creatures present at the time of the fire were found alive, and so Case was able see beauty in the bleak scene. &quot;It felt like this out-of-time Jacques Cousteau undersea expedition through a sunken World War II ship. Of course there&#39;s some shit I miss,&quot; she says, citing family photographs and a favorite sweater. &quot;But none of it matters.&quot;And as for those fairy tales she&#39;s writing and the history she&#39;s remembering: &quot;We need them now more than ever. We need stories from all sectors. Stories without endings. Stories with multiple endings. Stories that don&#39;t end happily, cautionary tales, everything. We don&#39;t need Disneyfied stories anymore.&quot;A force of nature, an act of a mercurial, forgotten god, Hell-On is a record sealed by fire, filled with love and rage and dangers that might lay waste to everything at any moment. So if you wake up dazed in a smoking landscape, walking through the detritus of your own lost civilization with the smell of ash in your hair, your favorite sweater gone and a new song in your head, don&#39;t say you weren&#39;t warned.",

		"description": " with KinZie<br> Is it possible to be nostalgic for the future? Brooklyn synthpop duo Great Good Fine Ok met one evening in 2013 and by the next morning had written their first song together, &quot;You&#39;re the One for Me,&quot; a gauzy, heart-thumping anthem that hit #1 on Hype Machine twice in one month and instantly established the group&#39;s sound with Jon Sandler&#39;s dancefloor falsetto soaring over Luke Moellman&#39;s lush post-Space Age production, the perfect soundtrack for retrofuturism. An EP, Body Diamond, soon followed, as did a slate of shows at that year&#39;s SXSW festival and a deal with Neon Gold and Epic Records. In 2014 GGFO&#39;s second EP, 2M2H, reached #10 on the iTunes dance chart and featured the St. Lucia collaboration &quot;Something to Believe In,&quot; which premiered on Entertainment Weekly. In keeping with this collaborative spirit, GGFO co-wrote and performed on The Chainsmoker&#39;s single &quot;Let You Go,&quot; recorded a cover of Phil Collins&#39;s &quot;Easy Lover&quot; with fellow Brooklynite Panama Wedding, and produced the song &quot;Shapeshifting&quot; with Irish folk-pop singer Orla Gartland, whom Jon and Luke met after their headlining show at Notting Hill Arts Club in London. They have also remixed songs by St Lucia, Foxes, Twenty One Pilots, Luxley, Little Daylight, and many others.In the past three years, GGFO have performed shows supporting acts ranging from Tove Lo to X Ambassadors to Penguin Prison and have embarked on four major US tours with Betty Who, Joywave, Magic Man, Vacationer, and Panama Wedding, with four songs reaching #1 on Hype Machine and their single &quot;Take It or Leave It&quot; surpassing ten million plays on Spotify. As anyone who attended the group&#39;s recent sold-out Northeast headlining tour can attest, GGFO has amassed a large contingent of loyal fans who have come to expect over-the-top live performances involving silk kimonos, triggered lights, and histrionic keytar solos, with Jon and Luke backed by drummer Danny Wolf and guitarist Carey Clayton. 2016 has already seen the release of three singles and an EP of GGFO songs remixed by like-minded artists, with more new works ever looming on the horizon. Music blog Indie Shuffle says, &quot;I dare you to find another group in the past two years who has been so prolific and consistent with their releases while at the same time delivering some of the most heavenly signature falsetto vocals known to man.&quot;",

		"description": " <br> Like a flood, middle school make out, or amateur adult film, it all began in the basement. The now-famed Yacht Rock Revue was once a band called Y-O-U, pursuing dreams of indie rock fame, when they were given free reign over Thursday nights at 10 High. In the Virginia- Highlands subterranean music lair, they did everything from original tunes to theme sets like Led Zeppelin vs. The Who to comedy (which bombed). But it was the impulse idea to smoothly croon 70s light rock (Hall & Oates, Michael McDonald, Linda Ronstadt, etc.) whilst wearing polyester, aviators, and captains hats that captured the peoples hearts. In early 2008, Yacht Rock became a weekly occurrence; by 2009 the citys cool kids were packing out 10 High on Thursdays nights and tossing back PBRs in their own captains hats, and by 2010, the eight guys (only one of whom has since left the band to join Blackberry Smoke) quit their day jobs and began stockpiling polyester suits.D id the indie rockers dream of being a cover band? About as much as a Rich Girl wants to get a job at Shoneys. But they were tapping into an underserved genre of music, captivating folks both young and old, and their legions of cultish fans are glad they stayed swayed with it. When they finally moved the tunes up to sea level, it was for a holiday show at the Variety Playhouse in 2009. Theyd never heard of a local band renting out the place for a concert, so decided to give it a whirl...and it sold out. Yacht Rock was legit.Larger gigs poured in (corporate events, weddings, Park Tavern) and the band wondered if they could get the very artists they covered to join them on stage while they were out on tour. Spoiler alert: They could (everyone has a price). It started with Walter Egan at a show in Nashville, and they have since shared the stage with Eddie Money, John Oates, and Bobby Kimball from Toto, to name just a few. Theyve played at the Playboy Mansion (obviously), sang the national anthem at the Atlanta Braves game on Fourth of July (complete with Greg and Nick jumping off stage and rounding the bases), opened for Ludacris and Macklemore and Ryan Lewis during the Final Four, sailed on music cruises with Kid Rock, Train, Heart, Weezer, and Kiss (for the record, they do NOT drive the boat), and have packed out shows in NYC, Nashville, Los Angeles, and more. The guys (who actually like each other in real life) have developed a flawless, signature style with spot-on renditions, refreshing comedy, and energetic stage presence any band would covet. Theyve received accolades like Best Place to Get Drunk With Your Dad to Best Overall Music Act in Atlanta to Best Place to Start an Extramarital Affair, and have been name-dropped by the New York Times, Pitchfork, the Guardian UK, Spin, TimeOut New York, Billboard, MTV.com, and (probably) your mom at her last Tupperware party.And its not always pure AM Gold glory, as they perform under many aliases: Please PleaseRock Me (Beatles), Reagan Rock (Smooth 80s) Uno Dos Tres Catorce (U2), Dazed and Confused (&#39;70s Stoner Rock), Rock Fight (Led Zeppelin vs. the Who, Tom Petty vs. Fleetwood Mac, etc.) and so forth. Yacht Rock Revue also performs many classic albums in their entirety, including Michael Jackson&#39;s Thriller, Pink Floyd&#39;s Dark Side of the Moon, Prince&#39;s Purple Rain, the Beatles&#39; Sgt. Pepper&#39;s Lonely Hearts Club Band, XTC&#39;s Black Sea, and Led Zeppelin IV. But no matter what theyre playing, its always a license to let loose. Smooth rock on, yall.",

		"description": " with KinZie<br> Is it possible to be nostalgic for the future? Brooklyn synthpop duo Great Good Fine Ok met one evening in 2013 and by the next morning had written their first song together, &quot;You&#39;re the One for Me,&quot; a gauzy, heart-thumping anthem that hit #1 on Hype Machine twice in one month and instantly established the group&#39;s sound with Jon Sandler&#39;s dancefloor falsetto soaring over Luke Moellman&#39;s lush post-Space Age production, the perfect soundtrack for retrofuturism. An EP, Body Diamond, soon followed, as did a slate of shows at that year&#39;s SXSW festival and a deal with Neon Gold and Epic Records. In 2014 GGFO&#39;s second EP, 2M2H, reached #10 on the iTunes dance chart and featured the St. Lucia collaboration &quot;Something to Believe In,&quot; which premiered on Entertainment Weekly. In keeping with this collaborative spirit, GGFO co-wrote and performed on The Chainsmoker&#39;s single &quot;Let You Go,&quot; recorded a cover of Phil Collins&#39;s &quot;Easy Lover&quot; with fellow Brooklynite Panama Wedding, and produced the song &quot;Shapeshifting&quot; with Irish folk-pop singer Orla Gartland, whom Jon and Luke met after their headlining show at Notting Hill Arts Club in London. They have also remixed songs by St Lucia, Foxes, Twenty One Pilots, Luxley, Little Daylight, and many others.In the past three years, GGFO have performed shows supporting acts ranging from Tove Lo to X Ambassadors to Penguin Prison and have embarked on four major US tours with Betty Who, Joywave, Magic Man, Vacationer, and Panama Wedding, with four songs reaching #1 on Hype Machine and their single &quot;Take It or Leave It&quot; surpassing ten million plays on Spotify. As anyone who attended the group&#39;s recent sold-out Northeast headlining tour can attest, GGFO has amassed a large contingent of loyal fans who have come to expect over-the-top live performances involving silk kimonos, triggered lights, and histrionic keytar solos, with Jon and Luke backed by drummer Danny Wolf and guitarist Carey Clayton. 2016 has already seen the release of three singles and an EP of GGFO songs remixed by like-minded artists, with more new works ever looming on the horizon. Music blog Indie Shuffle says, &quot;I dare you to find another group in the past two years who has been so prolific and consistent with their releases while at the same time delivering some of the most heavenly signature falsetto vocals known to man.&quot;",

		"description": " <p><a href=\"http://www.workplay.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/alex-guthrie-sq-6x6.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.alexguthriemusic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alex Guthrie</a></strong> is a singer-songwriter based in Atlanta. With the infusion of different genres such as soul, folk and rock, Guthrie brings audiences together through brilliant lyrics and an expressive voice.<p>Most recently, Guthrie has been noted as “the guy from the Jennifer Hudson commercial.” The now-infamous American Family Insurance <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpdKo6JnQJA\" rel=\"nofollow\">commercial</a> features him playing in Atlanta’s Woodruff Park when the Grammy Award-Winning singer and performer Jennifer Hudson surprises Guthrie and sings along to Bill Wither’s beloved “Lovely Day.” The commercial has played on national television and radio, resulting in new opportunities and heightened awareness for Alex Guthrie, his band and his music.<p>Guthrie and his band have performed events including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRrPME6Qu50&feature=youtu.be\" rel=\"nofollow\">Milwaukee’s Summerfest</a> — which was also featured on <a href=\"http://www.jimmykimmellivemusic.com/videos/american-family-insurance-summerfest-recap-4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jimmy Kimmel Live! Music</a> — as well as the 30A Songwriter’s Festival in Florida, Wire and Wood Songwriter Festival in Alpharetta, GA, Jammin’ Java Listening Room in Vienna, VA, the Elbo Room in Chicago, IL and Eddie’s Attic in Atlanta, GA.<p>In the early stages of his career, Guthrie released his first album, <em>Lessons Learned, </em>and also scored the Atlanta Braves Band of the Year in 2014. In 2015, Guthrie and his band were awarded the Georgia Americana Artist of the Year — another astounding achievement bringing his music much-deserved attention and recognition. Within a short span of time, Guthrie was opening up for national touring artists including renowned BMLG Records recording Artist Drake White, RCA recording artist Bleachers, and famous Atlantic Records recording Artist Kelly Clarkson.<p>Singer-songwriter Alex Guthrie continues to impress and defy conventional expectations, making waves as he makes great music. A new album is currently being recorded and is expected to be released in Spring 2018.<p><p><a href=\"http://www.workplay.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_9283.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>Born in the Philippines, raised in New York, educated in California and now entertaining Birmingham, AL, is one of the hottest musicians rising out of the growing music scene. Lily has built a buzz beyond just Birmingham, and many of those who follow the local music scene mention her as one of those Birmingham gems that is poised to explode onto the national and international scene. Her music mixes R&B, jazz, pop, folk and funk with her superb songwriting talents. She has played venues all over the country and remains busy with an enormous following on newly the emerging streaming platform, Twitch, and YouTube. She is looking to release a new album this year, and has recently released a video for her single, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYYQNdhzxoQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tinder Love</a>”</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>",

		"description": " Please join us for a night with Andy Gullahorn benefitting the Wood family&#39;s adoption.  Doors open at 6pm. Wine and beer will be available for purchase.  Join us for great music and celebration!  This is our final Fundraiser before we bring our son home! We would love your support and we are praying this is a great celebration of reaching our goal!  Andy Gullahorn moved to Nashville from Austin, TX in 1994 to attend Belmont University. After graduation, he found a job doing the very thing that drew him to Nashville in the first place: writing songs. If you ask him how to go about getting into the music business, he would say to do what he did and &quot;marry into it&quot;.  His wife, singer/songwriter Jill Phillips, signed with a major record label just months after their wedding and Andy started writing for her records and accompanying her on guitar for her concerts all over the country. In 2004 they had their second child and while Jill needed some time off of the road, Andy decided to start recording and performing his own songs again. Who else was going to pay the bills? That year he released his first recording in 6 years, Room To Breathe and began opening for and accompanying singer/songwriter, Andrew Peterson.  Andy has since released six more records: Reinventing the Wheel (2008), The Law Of Gravity (2010) Christmas (2011), Beyond The Frame (2013), FaultLines (2015) and Everything As It Should Be (2018).  Although he spends most of his time on the road playing concerts in houses, churches, clubs, conferences & retreats, he still makes time to write songs for other artists such as Sara Groves, David Wilcox, Big Daddy Weave, Brandon Heath, Jason Gray and Alicia Keys (in fairness, one of those artists he writes for hasn&#39;t ever heard the songs he wrote for her and has no idea who Andy is).  As a songwriter and performer, Andy has been described as a surgeon who uses laughing gas to deaden the pain before he cuts you open. Whether he is writing about marriage, honesty, faith, community or his friend&#39;s lawnmower accident, Andy&#39;s songs all come from the same desire. &quot;I really want to write songs that can act as healing agents,&quot; Andy says. &quot;Sometimes that healing might come through laughter and sometimes it comes from exploring deep sorrow. I try to be up for whatever it takes.&quot;  In his spare time Andy likes to bowl, play disc golf, make useless videos to post on YouTube, write Haikus, and hang out with his wife and three kids. And by &quot;hang out with the kids&quot; I mean &quot;get completely worn out&quot;.  ",

		"description": " with Abby Anderson, Presented by 102.5 The Bull<br> Russell Dickerson was born for the stage. Im just naturally that kind of dude: a big, loud and over-the-top guy, he says with a laugh. Yes, one of country musics most talked-about new talents -- and the voice behind the smash single Yours, a stunning ballad inspired by his wife of four years, Kailey, thats racked up over 33 million streams to date on Spotify, where hes been on the Hot Country, Country Gold Playlists and more for over a year, and exploded since being serviced to country radio in April -- need not go into entertainer mode before he catapults himself onstage to deliver one of his notoriously amped-up live shows.Hes already there.I go out there, and Im just me, Dickerson, who recently tore up arenas with Thomas Rhett and Kelsea Ballerini on the Home Team Tour, says. Watch the massive-voiced singer up there, whipping the crowd into hysterics and performing with that time-honored killer instinct. Hes running around and singing to people and messing with them and loving on them. Its about interacting the whole time. I want people screaming their faces off. Its all for the crowd.Even as a Union City, Tennessee-raised, obsessive teenage music fan, one whod regularly wait in wraparound lines to see his favorite artists perform in Nashville (I just got hooked on that energy) and held up Garth Brooks and Keith Urban DVDs as his personal Gospel, Dickerson, says being that dude onstage was always the dream. We would scream every word of every song, and all I could think about was I want to be that guy! Now, thanks to Yours and hook-heavy rockers like Blue Tacoma and MGNO, hes steadily built a serious fan base of his own.Strident, proud and fiercely determined in his artistry, Dickerson is that rare breed of artist who both writes with patient, staid intention and performs like a kid living out his wildest fantasy. Ive always envisioned myself playing stadiums. Honestly, as big as it will go, man, says the singer/songwriter who saw Yours explode on satellite radio and streaming services alike after Dickerson released his Billboard charting EP. The songs success led his manager at Dennis Entertainment to introduce him to the newly formed Triple Tigers, a joint venture with Sony Music, in October 2016 where he became the flagship artist.Now, with his forthcoming full-length debut album, Yours, Dickerson is gearing up for his most massive moment yet. Right now Im just so stoked on life so I wanted my record to mimic that, the 30-year-old says of a feel-good album stuffed with equal parts swagger (Billions, Float) and sweet vibes (All Fall Down, You Look Like A Love Song). We just kept rolling with it, he says of the loose, freewheeling writing sessions for the LP. To that end, if theres a palpable ease and whimsical flow to Dickersons melodies and lyrics its because hes found trusted collaborators, the most notable of which is his wife.It was Kailey, in fact, who not only inspired Yours but also dreamed up the idea for its stunning video. On a rainy day back in 2015, the Dickersons drove out near John C. Tune Airport and, with Russell strolling behind his car for what he thought was merely test footage, Kailey began filming. This spur-of-the-moment adventure that cost only the $6 required for gas money wound up producing the massively successful beautiful black-and-white music video for Dickersons breakout hit. To date, the video for Yours has been viewed more than three million times on YouTube. Its experiences like this, not to mention a fruitful writing partnership with longtime friends and fellow Belmont University graduates Parker Welling and Casey Brown, that has Dickerson feeling so inspired. Were just young kids writing relevant music, he says. And having all known each other for years, as well as seeing Russell and Kaileys relationship blossom, the trio all felt connected to Yours. Since then, theyve teamed to write the majority of the songs on his upcoming album as well. Its just cool to write with friends, Dickerson says. Its way less pressure and I can be myself. We just have this deeper connection.Its a feeling not dissimilar from one hes long held for music on the whole. The son of a piano-teaching mother and church choir-leading father, Dickerson was constantly surrounded by songs as a child. It was all around me, he remembers of an idyllic childhood. Dickerson credits discovering classic country artists like George Jones and Jim Reeves later in life as inspiring him to eventually pursue a career as a country music singer/songwriter. By the time he enrolled at Belmont and fell in with a group of hungry young musicians, he knew hed found his calling. It was really natural and young and innocent and we were having fun making music, he recalls.Dickerson says hed written hundreds of songs before that gut feeling kicked in one day in 2014 when he, Welling and Brown penned Yours. When we wrote it we all said This is amazing! And then it was just one thing after another, he says of the songs rocketship ride to radio. To get that affirmation from everyone at, what felt like, every step publishers, record label, radio is just so incredible. Adds Dickerson of the breakout song, which has become a wedding standard, and because of which he recorded an acoustic wedding version: Its such a boost of confidence. Its validation.Still, even as the accomplishments pile up, including the distinct honor of playing at the Grand Ole Opry last June (To be recognized for my craft by an establishment thats so esteemed in the industry was emotional), Dickerson remains steadfast in his pursuit of refining his craft and taking his career to new heights.For as long as weve prepped for this, Dickerson says, I hope this is just the beginning.",

		"description": " <br> &quot;The road goes on forever ...&quot;It&#39;s not always easy to sum up a career - let alone a life&#39;s ambition - so succinctly, but those five words from Robert Earl Keen&#39;s calling-card anthem just about do it. You can complete the lyric with the next five words - the ones routinely shouted back at Keen by thousands of fans a night (&quot;and the party never ends!&quot;) - just to punctuate the point with a flourish, but it&#39;s the part about the journey that gets right to the heart of what makes Keen tick. Some people take up a life of playing music with the goal of someday reaching a destination of fame and fortune; but from the get-go, Keen just wanted to write and sing his own songs, and to keep writing and singing them for as long as possible.&quot;I always thought that I wanted to play music, and I always knew that you had to get some recognition in order to continue to play music,&quot; Keen says. &quot;But I never thought of it in terms of getting to be a big star. I thought of it in terms of having a really, really good career and writing some good songs, and getting onstage and having a really good time.&quot;Now three-decades on from the release of his debut album - with eighteen other records to his name, thousands of shows under his belt and still no end in sight to the road ahead - Keen remains as committed to and inspired by his muse as ever. And as for accruing recognition, well, he&#39;s done alright on that front, too; from his humble beginnings on the Texas folk scene, he&#39;s blazed a peer, critic, and fan-lauded trail that&#39;s earned him living-legend (not to mention pioneer) status in the Americana music world. And though the Houston native has never worn his Texas heart on his sleeve, he&#39;s long been regarded as one of the Lone Star State&#39;s finest (not to mention top-drawing) true singer-songwriters. He was still a relative unknown in 1989 when his third studio album, West Textures, was released - especially on the triple bill he shared at the time touring with legends Townes Van Zandt and Guy Clark - but once fellow Texas icon Joe Ely recorded both &quot;The Road Goes on Forever&quot; and &quot;Whenever Kindness Fails&quot; on his 1993 album, Love and Danger, the secret was out on Keen&#39;s credentials as a songwriter&#39;s songwriter. By the end of the decade, Keen was a veritable household name in Texas, headlining a millennial New Year&#39;s Eve celebration in Austin that drew an estimated 200,000 people. A dozen years later, he was inducted into the Texas Heritage Songwriters Hall of Fame along with the late, great Van Zandt and his longtime friend from Texas A & M, Lyle Lovett.The middle child of a geologist father and an attorney mother, Keen was weaned on classic rock (in particular, the psychedelic blues trio Cream) and his older brother&#39;s Willie Nelson records - but it was his younger sister&#39;s downtown Houston celebrity status as a &quot;world-champion foosball player&quot; that exposed him to the area&#39;s acoustic folk scene. By the time he started working on his English degree at Texas A&M, he was teaching himself guitar and setting his poetic musings to song. That in turn led to a college fling with a bluegrass ensemble (featuring his childhood friend Bryan Duckworth, who would continue to play fiddle with Keen well into the &#39;90s) and front-porch picking parties with fellow Aggie Lovett at Keen&#39;s rental house - salad days captured in spirit on the Keen/Lovett co-write, &quot;The Front Porch Song,&quot; which both artists would eventually record on their respective debut albums.While Lovett&#39;s self-titled debut was released on major-label Curb Records, Keen took the road less travelled, self-financing and producing 1984&#39;s No Kinda Dancer and leasing it to the independent label Rounder Records, which issued it on its Philo imprint. &quot;It was difficult, because I didn&#39;t know what I was doing ... I literally opened up the phonebook and looked for studios,&quot; Keen recalls. &quot;I basically put it all together through brute force and ignorance, but I was shocked with how well it worked out and very happy with it. We had a release party at Butch Hancock&#39;s Dixie Bar and Bustop, and Lyle and Nanci Griffith and a lot of those people who were a part of the Austin folkie scene came out.&quot;Keen himself had already started to make quite a name for himself on that scene, thanks to four years of constant regional gigging and winning the Kerrville Folk Festival&#39;s prestigious New Folk songwriting competition in 1983. After his debut&#39;s release, he began touring more and more outside of the state lines, eventually moving to Nashville in 1986. Keen&#39;s stint in Music City, U.S.A., lasted just under two years, but he returned to Texas armed with a publishing deal, a new label (another indie, Sugar Hill), and a national booking agent. He closed the decade with 1988&#39;s The Live Album and the following year&#39;s West Textures, the album that marked the debut of &quot;The Road Goes on Forever&quot; and, not inconsequently, kicked his career into high gear.With hindsight, Keen admits he no idea at the time of writing it that his song about a couple of ill-fated lovers running afoul of the law would have the legs it did, but he readily points to the forward thinking of DJ Steve Coffman of San Antonio radio station KRIO for helping to start the fire. &quot;He talked the station into doing sort of a free-form programing format, basically anything he liked, which turned out to be some Texas music along with a lot of cool sort of pop music,&quot; he says. &quot;So all of a sudden, I heard my song back-to-back with the Sheryl Crow song that was popular at the time, and that was the first time that I really felt like I was a real part of the music business, despite having been in it already for a pretty long time. And right after that, I went to a show in San Antonio and there were 1,500 people there - whereas up to that point I&#39;d been playing to, max, maybe 150. That was the real ah-hah moment for me that really got me going and kept me going, because before that I&#39;d been doing this for eight or 10 years and had a lot of rejection but very little success.&quot;After that, though, success came in spades. Although he continued to steer clear of the Garth Brooks-dominated waters of the country mainstream, the perfect storm of Keen&#39;s literate song craft, razor wit and killer band (more on that in a bit) stirred up a grassroots sensation in Texas not seen since the &#39;70s heyday of maverick &quot;outlaw country&quot; upstarts Willie, Waylon, and Jerry Jeff Walker. Armed with two more albums (1993&#39;s A Bigger Piece of Sky and &#39;94&#39;s Gringo Honeymoon) brimming with instant classics like &quot;Corpus Christi Bay,&quot; &quot;Whenever Kindness Fails,&quot; &quot;Gringo Honeymoon,&quot; &quot;Dreadful Selfish Crime&quot; and &quot;Merry Christmas From the Family,&quot; he began packing dancehalls, roadhouses, theaters, and festival grounds with diverse crowds of rowdy college kids, serious singer-songwriter fans and plenty of folks who, like Keen himself, had been around the Texas music scene long enough to remember Willie&#39;s earliest 4th of July Picnics. And the phenomenon was not confined to the Texas state lines. Famed producer and pedal steel ace Lloyd Maines (Joe Ely, Terry Allen) helped Keen and his band bottle lighting on 1996&#39;s No. 2 Live Dinner, a next-best-thing-to-being-there concert document that remains one of Keen&#39;s best-selling albums, and the burgeoning Americana music scene (bolstered by AAA radio stations across the country and magazines like No Depression) embraced Keen as one of its prime movers. In the wake of albums like 1997&#39;s Picnic and &#39;98&#39;s Walking Distance (both released on major-label Arista), one would have been hard-pressed to tell the difference between a rabid Robert Earl Keen crowd at Texas&#39; legendary Gruene Hall and those at New York City joints like Tramps and the Bowery Ballroom. Little wonder, then, that when the songwriter-revering &quot;Americana&quot; style was officially recognized by the industry 1998, Keen was the genre&#39;s first artist to be featured on the cover of the radio trade magazine Gavin.The &#39;90s may have been a boom period for Keen, but his momentum hasn&#39;t ebbed a bit since the turn of the century - nor has his pursuit of continued growth as a writer and artist. If anything, his output from the last decade has been marked by some of the most adventurous music of his career. &quot;Wild Wind,&quot; an unforgettable highlight from Gravitational Forces, his Gurf Morlix-produced 2001 debut for the Nashville-based Americana label Lost Highway, captured the character (and characters) of a small Texas town with a cinematic eye reminiscent of The Last Picture Show; but the album&#39;s title track also found Keen wryly experimenting with spacey, beatnik jazz. For the freewheelin&#39;, freak-flag-flying Farm Fresh Onions (2003, Audium/Koch), Keen and producer Rich Brotherton (his longtime guitarist) took the band into the proverbial garage to knock out their most rocking set of songs to date - most notably the psychedelic rave-up of the title track. Brotherton also produced the more rootsy but equally playful What I Really Mean (2005, E1 Music), but Lloyd Maines was back at the helm for 2009&#39;s eclectic The Rose Hotel and 2011&#39;s spirited Ready for Confetti (both released by Lost Highway). The later was especially well received by fans and critics alike, with AllMusic&#39;s Thom Jurek raving, &quot;Ready for Confetti is, without question, Keen&#39;s most inspired and focused project in nearly 20 years.&quot; His latest project released in 2015, &quot;Happy Prisoner: The Bluegrass Sessions&quot; was a straight -ahead &quot;love postcard to bluegrass&quot;. This was something Keen had wanted to do for a long time and it was now or never. Keen is ranked Billboard&#39;s No. 2, 2015 Bluegrass Artist of the year. His current recording, Happy Prisoner: The Bluegrass Sessions, charted as 2015&#39;s Top 5 album at Americana Radio and Billboard&#39;s 2015 No. 2 album on the Bluegrass Albums chart.Earlier this year, Keen played three weeks of sold-out theater dates with Lyle Lovett, just two longtime college friends swapping songs on acoustic guitars like they used to do on Keen&#39;s front porch in College Station. But the lion&#39;s share of his concert schedule still finds him playing full-tilt with his seasoned road and studio band: Brotherton on guitar, Bill Whitbeck on bass, Tom Van Schaik on drums, and Marty Muse on steel guitar. &quot;I&#39;ve been with this band for 20 years now,&quot; Keen says proudly. &quot;I used to think that was just sort of an interesting fact, but now it&#39;s almost a total anomaly - that just doesn&#39;t happen much. I always felt like once you lock into the right bunch of people, you try to do the best by them that you can. So we&#39;ve been able to stay together a long time, and I think one thing that makes it worthwhile for people to come see us as an act is the fact that it&#39;s not like we&#39;re trying to work it all out onstage - we&#39;ve already worked everything out.&quot;REK has had the honor of working with music legends Dave Matthews, Bonnie Raitt, Sheryl Crow, Eric Church, Gary Clark, Jr. among others. He was inducted into the Texas Heritage Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2012. In March 2015, Robert Earl Keen was recognized as the first recipient of BMI&#39;s official Troubadour Award. Keen is an active member of NARAS and was invited to be a participant in the prestigious &quot;Grammys On The Hill&quot; where he sang the National Anthem at the opening ceremony and was a member of the delegation that lobbied US Congress to support musicians&#39; rights, specifically the &quot;Fair Pay for Fair Play Act&quot;.But the road goes on and on, with no time for resting on laurels. Not that Keen&#39;s complaining. &quot;I had a relatively open schedule for 2016 back at the beginning of the year, but it has just filled in like you wouldn&#39;t believe,&quot; he marvels during a rare day off in Kerrville, Texas (where he lives with his wife and two daughters). &quot;I&#39;ve broke my record this year - I&#39;ve packed for five trips at one time, because I wasn&#39;t going to be starting any of them in the same place. It&#39;s been crazy!It isn&#39;t always easy being Robert Earl Keen, but somebody&#39;s got to do it. And now more than ever, he&#39;s up to the task and loving every minute of it.",

		"description": " with Travis Meadows<br> In the lush tobacco fields of North Carolina where BJ Barham was raised, people work hard. Families stay nearby, toiling and growing together. BJ loves those farms and his tiny Reidsville hometown, but he had to run off and start American Aquarium, a band now beloved by thousands. BJ couldnt stay. But he couldnt really leave, either: hes still singing about the lessons, stories, and lives that define rural Americaand him.I moved to the big city to go to college and fell in love with music, BJ says. But half the songs on our record are about small townslittle pieces of my childhood. Ive had moments where it turns out a piece of broken English my father repeated twice a week is the most accurate way to say something. So I put it in a song.American Aquariums seventh studio album Things Change offers the bands finest collection of folk-infused Southern rock-and-roll to date. Stacked with BJs signature storytellingalways deeply personal but also instantly relatablethe record questions and curses current events, shares one mans intimate evolution, and leaves listeners with a priceless gift: hope. In my early 20s, I was not as hopeful, BJ says. Now, as Im getting ready to become a father, I think I have to be hopefulespecially with the situation our country is in now. For her sake, I have to be positive. He pauses. Her is his daughter, due in the spring of 2018. BJ adds, Being self-aware has always been a blessing and a curse. But thats whats always made my songwriting relatable to people. I dont hold back. Im almost too honest.BJs candor has fueled American Aquariums runaway appeal, visible most clearly in consistently sold-out shows across the country and throughout Europe - between 200 and 250 dates a year. Much has changed for the band and BJ since their acclaimed last effort, Wolves. In 2017, every American Aquarium member save BJ quit the group. American Aquarium has featured about 30 players since BJ founded the outfit in 2006, and while each member has left indelible marks, the band has always been anchored by the literary songs and sometimes roaring, sometimes whispering, drawl of BJ Barham. BJs personal life also underwent seismic shifts: He got sober. He got married. Soon, hell be a dad.Featuring a new band lineup that includes Shane Boeker on lead guitar, drummer Joey Bybee, bassist Ben Hussey, and Adam Kurtz on pedal steel and electric guitar, as well as a reinvigorated frontman in BJ, Things Change is American Aquariums first release on a label after selling thousands of records on their own. As an artist, your goal is for the newest thing you do to be better than the last. Youre slowly whittling away the bullshit to try and get to the truth, BJ says. With this album, I learned how to cut some of that fat so that its just truth. Its our best record.Recorded at 3CG Records in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Things Change was produced by Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter John Fulbright and features cameos from Americana standouts including John Moreland and Jamie Lin Wilson. Brazen album opener The World is on Fire is a richly layered rock-and-roll anthem that documents BJ and his wifes stunned reaction to the last presidential election. Emotional and conversational, the song taps into widespread feelings of confusion and fear: She said, What are we going to do? Whats this world coming to? / For the first time in my whole life, I stood there speechless. But what begins as despair builds into defiant faith, as BJ growls a call to action to cap off one of his favorite songs hes ever written. Im complaining about the state of things, and then the third verse almost serves as a challenge to myself: hey, youre in charge of another human being. You can create change, he says.Driving rock-and-roller Crooked + Straight explores the small-town consequences of questioning religion, and the tightness of family in the face of one members rejection. His fathers advice anchors the song. I come from a blue-collar family. Im the only one who didnt go into farming. I learned if you want something, you have to go out and take it. You cant expect anything from anybody, BJ says. You can only go out there and work harder. My dad always said you can outwork anybody else. Love for hard work and the people who carry it out appears repeatedly throughout Things Change. Guitar-heavy Tough Folks is a snarling ode to those with dirt under their fingernails, while bass- and pedal-steel-infused Work Conquers All spins a tale in praise and pursuit of Oklahomas state motto.The albums love songs are the kind of achingly beautiful that only comes with maturity and a willingness to expose ones own flaws. Haunting Shadows of You recalls a lovers flight as the protagonist longs for what he let get away. Gorgeous Till the Final Curtain Falls celebrates loyalty and pledges endless devotion. The moving title track takes an often doleful topicpeoples tendency to changeand turns it on its head, tracing BJs personal growth and recognizing his now-wifes steadfast love. BJs other two favorite tracks are album standouts. Moving When We Were Younger Men addresses the break-up of American Aquarium head on. As BJ professes love for his former bandmates over stripped down acoustic guitar, his voice is honeyed and deep. Its an open letter to five guys who I spent eight years of my life with seeing the entire world, BJ says. I think anyone who has ever had to walk away from a friendship or has had somebody walk away from them will relate to the song. Stunner One Day at a Time is self-perceptive and vulnerable, detailing BJs battles with himself. Even within his career full of well-written gems, the song is a towering accomplishment.At the end of the day, if youre not writing songs to affect other peoples lives, youre in it for the wrong reasons, BJ says, reflecting on the new album, where hes been, and where American Aquarium is headed. Money may come and go. You may never get fame. But if you sit down and write songs to affect people, you can do it your whole life and be happy.",

		"description": " <br> Is it premature to see Hall of Fame material in a guy who&#39;s just releasing his first album?Not if that guy is Tony Jackson.To put it plainly, Jackson is one of the most gifted singers ever to grace country music.His initial videos from the album have excited over 25 Million Facebook views seemingly overnight, while Jackson tours tirelessly in support of the record.The respect Jackson has already earned within the music community is evident throughout Tony Jackson, as the new album is titled. It features songs and/or performances by Rock and Roll Hall of Fame members John Sebastian, Steve Cropper and Dr. John Mac Rebennack, Country Music Hall of Famers Vince Gill, Bill Anderson and Conway Twitty and Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame luminary Norro Wilson.It is the ease with which Jackson makes every songeven the familiar onesdistinctly his own that sets him apart. Who else would dare to try and then succeed in bringing a fresh layer of emotional urgency to such a classic as George Jones&#39; The Grand Tour or Conway Twitty&#39;s eternal It&#39;s Only Make Believe?On the first-time and lesser known songs, Jackson mints his own classics. With its sweeping steel guitar flourishes and ambient barroom clatter, he transforms John Sebastian and Phil Galdston&#39;s Last Call into the sweetest, most affectionate separation ballad imaginable. With reverence and a twinkle in his eye, he enlists Sebastian and Vince Gill in revivifying (after 50 years) the Lovin&#39; Spoonful&#39;s 1966 romp, Nashville Cats. When asked if we should recut the song, Sebastian begins, I said absolutely but we have to get Vince Gill, Paul Franklin and todays real Nashville Cats in on the session and fortunately it was preserved on video, he beams.After capturing perfectly, the excitement of new love in Bill Anderson&#39;s I Didn&#39;t Wake Up This Morning, he moves on to a memory-stirring homage to Merle Haggard, Hank Williams Jr. and Willie Nelson in They Lived It Up, a lyrical scrapbook from Anderson and Bobby Tomberlin.Jackson shines as a keen-eyed songwriter in his own right with such memorable excursions as Drink By Drink, Old Porch Swing, and She&#39;s Taking Me Home.From start to finish, Tony Jackson stands out as a discovery album, the kind you listen to with such delight that you have to recommend it to friends. And hundreds of thousands have done just that.Jackson is currently a headliner on the Old Dominion Barn Dance in Richmond, Virginia, and is almost certainly the only major bank executive ever to abandon a prominent IT job in finance at a Fortune 500 company to embark on a career in country music. But he didn&#39;t grow up a country fan.The son of a Navy man, he led a base-to-base existence, at one point living with his family in Rota, Spain for three years. His early musical background was sketchy at best. I sang &#39;White Christmas&#39; in the Christmas play in the sixth grade, he recalls. Everybody seemed to love it, but I was a wreck. My mother forced me to sing in the church choir, but I was kind of buried in the voices along with everybody else. This was basically his entire musical resume until ten or so years ago when a friend whose band had lost its lead singer asked Jackson to try out for the spot. I did, he says, and I was hooked after that.Two weeks after graduating from high school, Jackson joined the Marines. I told my dad I was joining because I was sick of taking orders, he says with a wry grin. There was as much getting-ahead as gung-ho in Jacksons enlistment. I was a computer and electronics geek as a teenager, he says. When I talked to the recruiter, he told me the Marine Corps had just started a computer science school in Quantico, Virginia. Fortunately, I scored high enough on the entrance exam to go to that school. It was a smart move. When he finished service, a prominent bank in Richmond snapped him up to work in its Information Technology division, initially assigning him the lowly chore of re-setting passwords. I was way overqualified, he says, so I got promoted fast. I was a senior vice president by my early 30s.It was while in the Marines that he first started paying serious attention to country music. My mother listened only to gospel, he says. My dad was into jazz, hip hop, R&B, new jack swingstuff like that, but Armed Forces Radio played everything. When I was living in Spainwhen I was 10 to 13Randy Travis came over there on a USO tour. Some friends and I were out there early when they were setting up the stage, and we actually got to talk to him before we realized he was the guy whod be performing later. He was really cool to us. In the Marine Corps, when my friends and I played music for each other, we were all homesick. So when youd listen to these country songs that talked about family and home and heartbreak, it would really grab you.A song that particularly appealed to Jackson was George Jones heartbreaking 1974 hit, The Grand Tour. When Jones died, Jackson and some friends went into a Richmond studio and recorded it. In the process, they also made a performance video that eventually wound up on YouTube. By sheer accident, singer Donna Dean Stevens saw the video and instantly decided Jackson should do The Grand Tour on the Old Dominion Barn Dance, which she had just resurrected. After she witnessed Jacksons standing ovationan honor that hadnt yet been accorded to any of the shows headlinersshe offered to co-manage and co-produce him with noted talent manager Jim Della Croce. A commanding performer in her own right, Dean Stevens recorded for Mercury Records in Nashville as Donna Meade. She is also the widow of Country Music Hall of Fame member Jimmy Dean and a zealous guardian of his vast musical legacy.Dean Stevens and Della Croce then whisked Jackson to Nashville, where he recorded most of Tony Jackson at the hallowed RCA Records Studios. In one of his best-loved songs, George Jones considered the dwindling ranks of country superstars and asked plaintively Who&#39;s Gonna Fill Their Shoes.Tony Jackson volunteering for duty.",

		"description": " with Madeline Kenney<br> The Louder I Call, The Faster It Runs-the triumphant fifth album by Wye Oak-begins with an explosion. For a few seconds, piano, drums, and a playful keyboard loop gather momentum; then, all at once, they burst, enormous bass flooding the elastic beat. &quot;Suffering, I remember suffering,&quot; sings Jenn Wasner, her voice stretched coolly across the tizzy. &quot;Feeling heat and then the lack of it/But not so much what the difference is.&quot; The moment declares the second coming of Wye Oak, a band that spent more than a decade preparing to write this record-its most gripping and powerful set of songs to date, built with melodies, movement, and emotions that transcend even the best of their catalogue.Louder is the third record that Wasner and Andy Stack, who launched Wye Oak in Baltimore, have made while living in separate cities-she in Durham, North Carolina, he in Marfa, Texas. They flew to one another for a week or so at a time, hunkering in home studios to sort through and combine their separate song sketches. These shorter stints together produced less second-guessing and hesitation in their process, yielding an unabashed and unapologetic Wye Oak. They discarded past rules about using just guitar or keyboard to write a record, instead funneling all those experiences and experiments into perfectly unified statements. The result is the biggest, broadest, boldest music they&#39;ve ever made. The title track is a coil of anxiety and exuberance, its verses and chorus sweeping into cascades of magnetic harmony. By the time the song ends, it feels like a real pop anthem, a spell to be shouted against the ills of our world.Louder pursues a litany of modern malaises, each of its dozen tracks diligently addressing a new conflict and pinning it against walls of sound, with the song&#39;s subject and shape inextricably and ingeniously linked. The rapturous &quot;Lifer,&quot; for instance, ponders perseverance and survival in times of profound struggle. It is, at first, hesitant and ponderous, Wasner wrestling with her own choices. But her ecstatic guitar solo leads into a chorus that feels like a triumph over doubt, or at least a reconciliation with it. &quot;Over and Over&quot; finds Wasner alone at home, watching clips of violence abroad on repeat, her outrage outstripped only by her ineffectiveness. Stack&#39;s colossal circular rhythm and Wasner&#39;s corroded harmonies conjure a digital hall of mirrors, a place where we can see all evil but do nothing. During the intoxicating &quot;It Was Not Natural,&quot; a tired walk through the woods unearths a discarded antler, a talisman that provokes deep questions about our work lives, social codes, and romantic mores. The music-a sophisticated tessellation of pounded piano and loping bass, scattered drums and chirping synthesizer-is as complex and ponderous as the issues themselves. &quot;It Was Not Natural&quot; is Wye Oak at their most sophisticated, navigating life&#39;s difficulties with the nuance and power they demand.For all the struggles Wye Oak confronts here, Louder ultimately reflects a hopeful radiance, with the parting sense that human connection and our own internal resolve can outweigh even our heaviest worries. The final two tracks are tandem testaments to weakness bowing to strength. Wasner first shuffles through her day during &quot;Join,&quot; beset by worry until she finds a way out. &quot;I just want a clear head,&quot; she realizes at the end, &quot;the sun on my shoulder.&quot; And during &quot;I Know It&#39;s Real,&quot; over twinkling guitars and a drum beat that feels like a steadying pulse, she stumbles upon a necessary credo: &quot;Still, I&#39;m alive, stronger than energies riding on my back.&quot;The Louder I Call, The Faster It Runs arrives at a time of immense doubt, when our personal problems are infinitely compounded by a world that seems in existential peril. But these dozen songs answer the challenge by radiating self-reflection and resolve, wielding hooks and musical intricacy as a shield against the madness of the moment. The Louder I Call, The Faster It Runs is a powerful reminder to keep calling, to keep trying, no matter the peril it poses. Merge Records will release The Louder I Call, The Faster It Runs TK TK, 2018.",

		"description": " with Cory Branan<br> Amanda Shires is not an entertainer. She isnt looking to help listeners escape their everyday lives or soundtrack celebrations. She isnt reaching for celebrity, and she isnt concerned with cultivating a personal brand. She is an artist in the true sense of the word, meaning she creates because she has a real need for the process of creating. That is not to say that the songs on My Piece Of Landarent entertaining, but that quality is a by-product. The real intention here is to relate. Ms. Shires began her career as a teenager playing fiddle with the Texas Playboys. Since then, shes toured and recorded with John Prine, Billy Joe Shaver, Todd Snider, Justin Townes Earle, Shovels & Rope, and most recently her husband Jason Isbell. Along the way shes made three solo albums, each serving to document a particular period in her life while improving on the perceptive qualities of the previous record. The songs on My Piece Of Land deal with family, with anxiety, with the phases of one young womans life; but the primary focus of My Piece Of Landis the concept of home. Ms. Shires addresses the similarities and differences between the home she was born into, the two homes she was eventually split between, and the home she has finally made for herself. Some of these stories are from the creators point of view and some most certainly are not. Youd be hard-pressed to identify which is which, though, considering the level of empathy involved in the creation of these stories. The concept of home, like the concept of love, is more complex than it seems, says Ms. Shires. You start out with this inherited idea of home, but as you grow you realize thats only a suggestion. You have to use that along with all the little pieces of wisdom youve picked up along the way to finally build your own place in the world. Ms. Shires sometimes describes songwriting as solving the puzzles, but before the songwriter even begins to arrange rhymes and melodies, she must first be acquainted with the complicated workings of the heart. Most of this album was written after Ms. Shires had reached the seven-month point in a summertime pregnancy, and was no longer able to travel. For a woman used to touring most of the year, being stuck inside brought challenges and offered creative rewards. Pregnancy does weird things to you, Amanda says. You walk around holding your arms over your belly, sometimes almost overcome by anxiety. I constantly wondered if I would be able to protect this child, if my marriage would last forever, if Id learned enough about the world to be a good mother. At the same time, youre so excited, so hopeful, and so severely physically limited. About how the setting affected the finished product, she says This record turned out to be a personal record, set in our home where I had lots of time for reflection and time to face my concerns and fears. The listener can hear Ms. Shires unpacking those anxieties in a song like Slippin, with its ruminations on what could go wrong in a relationship that seems stable. Therell be a trigger,then up starts the fire,a handful of matchessome faulty wiring.Youll say you have this hollow feeling. Somethings always been missing. Tonight could be the night you go slippin&#39; away from me. Her piece of land is one with a panoramic view, and she pays close attention to even the smallest details. Take, for instance, the first stanza of Harmless. A phased golden light rained down from the streetlight. It fell across your shoulder, paused just above your collar. With this description of one fleeting moment, the writer sets an entire scene. Ms. Shireswould argue that the term poet should not be used to mean unusually perceptive songwriter, since the roles of modern songwriter and poet are so very different. However, it isnt hard to understand how her post-graduate education in poetry helps Ms. Shires choose which details to include. Its all about precision. My time in the MFA (Master Of Fine Arts) program at Sewanee taught me a lot about different ways of writing and how they all have one thing in common: the better you are at editing, the better your work will be. Spending long hours workshopping poems and reading the classics gave me a solid standard when it came time to edit my songs. Ms. Shires recorded My Piece Of Land under the guidance of brilliant Nashville producer Dave Cobb at his Low Country Sound studio. Inviting Cobb to produceMy Piece Of Landwas an easy decision to make, considering Ms. Shires had worked with him before on Jason Isbell&#39;s albums Southeastern and Something More Than Free. Ms. Shires knew of Daves propensity toward arranging the songs in-studio, rather than rehearsing or making demos beforehand. Cobb believes in the spontaneity of early takes, and with the proficient rhythm section of Paul Slivka and Paul Griffith, the studio band was able to record the album in a relatively short amount of time without sacrificing performance quality. This approach gives each song on the album emotional urgency along with a groove thats loose and effortless. Among other things, Pale Fire is about consciously shifting ones own priorities. There are two types of lovers: the kind we need and the kind we want. The hard part is finding someone who represents both. You Are My Home is written as a gift, a token of appreciation to someone who has helped the narrator define her place in the world. Mineral Wells is a song Ms. Shires wrote many years ago, after relocating to Nashville from her childhood home in Texas. It speaks to the part of us that never really leaves that original homeplace. With My Piece Of Land, you get the sense that Amanda Shires has reached a personal pinnacle. This album is the creative milestone suited to accompany the recent milestones in her life: becoming a mother, developing into a true artist, and finally finding a home.",

		"description": " <br> When Grizzly Bear came to the end of the road with their fourth album, 2012&#39;s &#39;Shields&#39;,the future was unclear. No dramatic decisions were made, no arguments were had, butthere was a feeling as there always is with the foursome that a breather was required.The band who emerged in 2004 in Brooklyn, New York, have forever functioned as aself-described democracy. It&#39;s equal and it&#39;s fair but it can also take a lot of out ofthem. And so they went their separate ways and bedded down in different corners.Vocalist and songwriter Ed Droste adapted back to life in Los Angeles, his new adoptedhome and decided to distance himself from music and the industry, vocalist, songwriter,and multi-instrumentalist Daniel Rossen moved to a remote area of upstate New Yorkand continued to write and record on his own, drummer, songwriter, and multiinstrumentalistChristopher Bear continued playing with various projects and worked onscoring a tv series, and vocalist, multi-instrumentalist, songwriter, and producer ChrisTaylor decided to go West to LA after a one year stint in Berlin. He produced for otherartists and made a solo record under the moniker CANT. Taylor, however, got restless.The band&#39;s mediator since the beginning, his feet started to itch after the usual sixmonths of downtime. I kinda kept writing everyone, he says. Telling them that weshould start making a record. I wanted to be making music with my band again. I stayedbusy, I wrote a cook book, produced other people, but my favorite thing to do was workwith my band. I was getting bored over here. He laughs. While all four members werestrewn across their various corners, he took it upon himself to start a cloud account essentially a dropbox. The intention was to allow the band a gentler entry point forstarting to think about coming together again. It was new for them, less pressurized, farmore relaxed and a guaranteed prevention measure against creative stalemate. Thedropbox was a home for inspiration, mood boards, ideas for music, demos, even songs.It was, however, quite a slow process, starting in March 2015. Painfully slow, chucklesTaylor. They did have one song &#39;Losing All Sense&#39; that made it to the record, butRossen was reticent to call this the beginning of something. The word &#39;album&#39; was aforbidden utterance at this point in time. We got into the water with one toe at a time toavoid freaking everyone out, recalls Taylor. Yeah this time around we came to itslowly, agrees Rossen. Tip-toeing towards a conversation.Chris Taylor started this motherfucker, adds Droste. I&#39;m so grateful to him because Idon&#39;t know whether it would have organically happened otherwise. Taylor even boughta guitar after five months of little progress and wrote in Big Sur. The song &#39;Sky TookHold&#39; got its start in one of those sessions. Taylor wrote the song &#39;Systole&#39; during histime in Berlin, and it is his first lead vocal for the band. I learned guitar so I could writesongs for the band, he says, as eager as he was then to be in conversation aboutGrizzly Bear. Once that catalyst came, there was still the question of whether or not itwas going to work. I&#39;m of the mindset that I never know if we&#39;ll make another album, nomatter how good or bad things are, says Droste. In a way it&#39;s a miracle this albumhappened because for a while it was to be decided. When it started to come togetherthere were a lot of ideas. Some didn&#39;t work. Eventually when things started to work wewere like, &#39;Oh my god it&#39;s happening.&#39;That relief, that momentum, that sense of a band really relishing the chance to relocatetheir mojo is apparent on the album, which wound up taking two years to make, viaremote writing trips taken variously by Taylor and Droste, and Bear and Rossen, then a retreat to Allaire Studios in New York in June 2016 once there was more of a cohesivecollection of songs. That&#39;s where they recorded a lot of 2009&#39;s &#39;Veckatimest&#39;. In additionto Allaire, they recorded in Vox Studios in Hollywood and at Taylor&#39;s LA studio in EchoPark. Rossen also continued to track parts for the record at his home upstate.It was so exciting when it was starting to work, says Droste. Perhaps what wasdifferent this time around was the communication barriers were set free. There was anakedness to receiving each other&#39;s ideas and a lack of tying expectations to particularresults. The whole affair was positively zen. I was coming at it like I have to be openwith everything, says Droste. Let&#39;s try anything and let it go. If it doesn&#39;t work, it doesn&#39;twork. Don&#39;t be precious or get upset when other bandmates don&#39;t like it. Keep trying.The resulting fifth Grizzly Bear album &#39;Painted Ruins&#39; benefits from having the songsdevelop in a completely organic way. We had a lot of fun making the record, saysRossen. Even though there are serious themes we tried to keep the sound as light aspossible. Maybe it&#39;s a matter of being a little older and not assuming that there should beso much wrapped up in what we were doing. That&#39;s what immediately bleeds forth whenyou listen through to the eleven tracks. Does it sound totally different? asks Droste,champing at the bit to get the juggernaut started again. More inviting?Indeed there&#39;s a deep warmth, a flirtatiousness to the sonic ideas, and a sense ofplayfulness that&#39;s perhaps the most surprising of all. It&#39;s a direct reflection of the joy theyexperienced while making it. It chimes with collective exhales, and the genuine love thatcame from reuniting with old friends. You forget that you have this great thing going onwith us, even though it can be really difficult, says Droste. When we finally got togetherit felt like there was a musical chemistry that was as real as it was when we were kids.That was thrilling in a way that was still the case, adds Rossen. You could almost saythat the band&#39;s propensity to chuck lots of ideas at the wall to see which ones stuck wasthe closest an established act can get to tapping into that energy that exists whilerecording a debut.For all four members the results of the sessions were unexpected. Droste points to&#39;Mourning Sound&#39; and closing track &#39;Sky Took Hold&#39;. That song was fleshed out in avery different way, then one day they added an ominous horn section that repeats and itchanged the whole thing for me, says Droste. That&#39;s what I love about working withthem. They just have ideas I would never have, and vice versa. It&#39;s a challenge to be in ademocratic band with strong opinions but I also thank god because we get all thesedifferent creative ideas that don&#39;t come naturally. It&#39;s very much four people. It alwayshas been. It always will for as long as we continue on. These are the three people whocontinually surprise me.Rossen came up with the title &#39;Painted Ruins&#39;. As usual, the band are more comfortableleaving the visuals, the lyrics, the themes to the listener&#39;s imagination, so you can takefrom their art what you will. I don&#39;t relate to a lot of explicit storytelling music, explainsDroste, before making up something on the spot. &#39;Her name was Jenny and she brokemy heart and then I went on a cruise&#39; Ok, don&#39;t know Jenny, haven&#39;t been on a cruise!Instead &#39;Painted Ruins&#39; has a different meaning to each member of the band. It&#39;s theidea of dressing up something that&#39;s falling apart and making something out of asituation that&#39;s crumbling, says Rossen. In a way that&#39;s how a lot of this music cametogether. Some of it was a pastiche and it found its way into a cohesive form.There&#39;s also clearly a connotation with the general breakdown that&#39;s happening in thewider world, which can also be mirrored in the band&#39;s lives as they reached their latethirties. We all were hoping to achieve a sense of personal decay or breakdownrepresenting a larger whole or situation, not necessarily writing topical music but writingpersonal music that could represent larger strife, adds Rossen. For Bear, the album isabout personal reflection. Observing yourself, he explains. Seeing how you&#39;reinteracting when you&#39;re going through change. It&#39;s not a breakup record or a socialcommentary record, there&#39;s a lot of sides to the human experience.&#39;Painted Ruins&#39; isn&#39;t a passing pleasure, it&#39;s a body of work intended to be lived in. Itspsychedelic grooves, challenging composition and pensive lyrics require repeated listensand develop significance, attachment and deep-rooted appreciation over time. That saidit strays from getting too intense or introspective. Some of the tracks take on a morepersonal bent. The likes of &#39;Wasted Acres&#39; and &#39;Neighbors&#39;, the former of which is aboutRossen&#39;s life in upstate New York. That tune started as a simple and direct lyric aboutcollecting firewood with my dog, says Rossen. &#39;Four Cypresses&#39;, on the other hand, withits refrain of it&#39;s chaos but it works is more political, though the band would prefer tokeep the overtones less explicit.Droste has been a staunch advocate for politics online via social media these past fewyears. The band recognize the importance of that but don&#39;t feel that it necessarily needsto be written into the music. As soon as the Election was over I thought about howvaluable it is to be able to connect with other people through music, says Rossen, who&#39;santicipating touring this record more than anything. It&#39;s even more valuable in thispolitical climate, where you can impart a sense of shared experience, compassion,empathy or just humanity. You look at the news every day and it feels overwhelming andtruly bleak, you feel like giving up. There&#39;s a huge value in the ability to make somethingthat connects with other people.Having met with so many accolades that would have been deemed unfathomable tothem in the early days, you wonder what Grizzly Bear set out to achieve with anotheralbum. They opened for Radiohead on their debut (a total mindfuck according toDroste). They played Radio City Music Hall on their last record &#39;Shields&#39;. Are there anytangibles they&#39;d love to chase? I&#39;d just like to reach new people, says Droste, simply. Iwant to grow. A lot of writing has to do with selfish reasons. Getting shit out of yoursystem, self-therapy. My favorite thing of all is the performing and the connection. ForRossen, it&#39;s all about the music. If we can continue working together and enjoy whatwe&#39;re making and feel that it&#39;s vital to us, if we can do that in a sustained way that&#39;sabout as much as I can hope for.Taylor, on the other hand, wears his heart firmly on his sleeve. I&#39;m excited that I&#39;mbetter friends with everyone in the band than ever, he says. Life is too short not toenjoy what youre doing. Were in a lucky situation.",

		"description": " <br> Five years have passed since Case&#39;s last solo project, The Worse Things Get, the Harder I Fight, the Harder I Fight, the More I Love You. In the interim, she sang on Whiteout Conditions, the 2017 release from longtime bandmates the New Pornographers. The year before that, she released a vinyl box set of her solo work and joined k.d. Lang and Laura Veirs on the case/lang/veirs project.Recording that record was a revelation, from Veirs&#39; innovative guitar tunings to Lang&#39;s skills in studio. &quot;I learned so much experiencing the work ethic of those two,&quot; Case says. She considers Lang &quot;probably the most natural producer I&#39;ve ever seen. Watching her work was awe-inspiring.&quot;After their national tour together, Case found similar transcendence in October 2016 sitting on a panel at the first-of-its-kind &quot;Woman Producer&quot; summit in Brooklyn, NY. Between discussions and performances from a diverse group of women who produce music from around the world, she wondered how it had taken such a long time to get to that moment, and why so many female pioneers had been forgotten.She felt lucky to have worked with the people she had encountered across her career-Darryl Neudorf, Tucker Martine, Craig Schumacher, and Chris Schultz among them-who encouraged her to expand her own skills in studio. But she had also gotten fed up with a world in which women&#39;s accomplishments seemed to vanish from public memory. &quot;The George Martins and Quincy Joneses of the recording pantheon deserve every drop of praise and every project they have received,&quot; Case says. &quot;But we can&#39;t keep telling the same stories over and over. We need more stories, more inspiration, more flavors.&quot;She set to work on her next record looking for not just new stories but also new sounds. This time, she wanted to put herself in a setting far away from everything she knew. She recalled Bjrn Yttling&#39;s skill with Lykke Li, Camera Obscura, and his own band, Peter Bjorn and John. &quot;I&#39;ve worked with the same people so long, I never had to step outside my comfort zone,&quot; Case says. &quot;In this instance, I chose to.&quot;The two met over breakfast in Washington, DC, and decided to team up. By the time she went to Sweden in the fall of 2017, Case had already written songs with longtime collaborator Paul Rigby, laid down vocal and guitar tracks at WaveLab Studio in Tucson, and built Carnacial Singing, her recording space in Vermont.But in the middle of her stint in Stockholm, with the finish line in sight, she received a surreal 3am call telling her that her house was burning and would likely be completely destroyed. She felt panicked and helpless.The fire had started in the barn, where she kept an assortment of belongings, from artwork to old pianos. A friend had managed to get the dogs to safety. After the flames jumped to the house, her home was engulfed, too.A few hours later, she went into a studio in Stockholm and laid down the vocals for &quot;Bad Luck,&quot; singing the lines she had written long before she realized they would land on her.Case is now stoic about the fire. &quot;If somebody burned your house down on purpose, you&#39;d feel so violated. But when nature burns your house down, you can&#39;t take it personally.&quot; The month before the blaze, Hurricane Harvey had slammed into Texas and flooded Houston. Her home burned just as Puerto Rico was plunged into a nightmare by Hurricane Maria and wildfires incinerated California. &quot;In the big picture, my house burning was so unimportant,&quot; she says. &quot;So many people lost so much more: lives and lives and lives.&quot;She was hell-bent on not losing sight of the goal, reminding herself there was still beauty in the world and in the process of making music. She had been reading a lot of ancient history, including Adrienne Mayor&#39;s The Amazons, and thinking about how for millennia, women have been more central to events than the average history class admits. &quot;We were always there, we were just erased. And I knew it. As a little girl I knew it. As a young person I knew it,&quot; Case says. &quot;Now I know it anew with a ferocious, righteous, razor-sharp tribe of witnesses, and it makes me feel like a super-powerful human being. It makes me feel joy. There&#39;s an inheritance there that&#39;s really important, and I want to share it.&quot;She decided to climb inside her role as producer and wield it more directly. It just meant owning what she was already doing.***The record that came out of this reckoning with lost stories delivers both familiar Neko Case and something different. Death, extinction, exploitation, tides, animals, and adoration all blend recognizably. Case&#39;s trademark narrative gaps, just large enough for listeners to enter each song, likewise remain. As with Fox Confessor Brings the Flood and Middle Cyclone, Hell-On spins away from conventions of story, slipping into real life, with its fierce mess and blind catastrophes.&quot;I&#39;m writing fairy tales, and I hear my life story in them, but they&#39;re not about me,&quot; Case says. &quot;I still can&#39;t figure out how to describe it. But I think that&#39;s why we make music or write things. You&#39;ve got to invent a new language.&quot;There are differences, too. The opening kalimba notes of the first track, &quot;Hell On,&quot; lead into a waltz of deep forces, irresistible as gravity, that refuse to be leashed or controlled (&quot;You&#39;ll not be my master / you&#39;re barely my guest&quot;). This tornado might not love you.Case planned this record with a commitment to big choruses and a goal of making them even bigger. The results appear in the anthemic &quot;Last Lion of Albion,&quot; a requiem for every landscape and iconic creature (&quot;last tiger of Tasmania / the last she-wolf to suckle Rome&quot;) erased through massacre and marketing. Rounding out the opening trilogy of false possession is &quot;Halls of Sarah,&quot; a song for unwilling muses tormented by poets who love women &quot;as lions love Christians.&quot;&quot;Bad Luck,&quot; recorded from the ground up in Stockholm, opens at a gallop and never breaks stride. A song always poses the challenge of when to move away from the groove and how to get back to it. But Yttling pointed out to Case that sometimes the whole song should be the hook-that there&#39;s no shame in exploiting the catchiest part. That became the strategy for bringing &quot;Bad Luck&quot; to life. Longtime collaborators Kelly Hogan and Nora O&#39;Connor came up with backing vocals that build a giddy, knowing call and response into the song.For &quot;The Curse of the I-5 Corridor,&quot; former Screaming Trees frontman Mark Lanegan duets with Case on a ballad of memory and departure. Melancholy grooves &quot;Gumball Blue&quot; and &quot;My Uncle&#39;s Navy&quot; mark Case&#39;s first songwriting efforts with New Pornographers cofounder Carl Newman. And after performing it live for years, Case has finally done a studio recording with Eric Bachmann of his song &quot;Sleep All Summer,&quot; which moved her to pull over to the side of the road and cry the first time she heard it on the radio.The labyrinthine &quot;Dirty Diamond&quot; opens onto room after room of shifting vocals that soar above a march-like rhythm. &quot;Oracle of the Maritimes,&quot; perhaps the most fairy tale song on the record, floats over a tuning invented by co-writer Laura Veirs, carrying a love that longs to prove itself (&quot;come on sweet girl let&#39;s find you an ocean / that goes with your eyes&quot;).Clouds of mosquitoes rising out of hot tires, a chest of drawers that rides out into the waves, a box filled with unnamed newborn creatures: these songs are bursting with images that can only be understood through peripheral vision, shards of imaginary lives wired into a mosaic.Later comes &quot;Winnie,&quot; a pirate love song for a woman with a mouth &quot;as sharp as the rib of a star.&quot; The song came from the afterglow of reading Amazons. &quot;There aren&#39;t enough songs that are obviously about a woman loving another woman, just loving her, Sapphic or Platonic,&quot; Case says. &quot;I thought there should be one, because I know I sit around loving them all day.&quot;The record ends with &quot;Pitch or Honey,&quot; winding its way through intimate verses sung over a drum machine before blooming into layered vocals, a bigger beat, and a wall of sound. &quot;Am I making pitch or honey?&quot; fades into repetition of &quot;I love you better when you&#39;re wild.&quot;The record was born at the hands of some three dozen performers in all, from k.d. Lang, Laura Veirs, Beth Ditto, and Robert Forster on backing vocals, to Joey Burns of Calexico and Doug Gillard of Guided by Voices on guitars, and Barbara Gruska and Matt Chamberlain on drums. The sidelong perspective is part of the known Neko galaxy, but the production is more expansive and edgier, moving into new universes. These are songs that can swallow you.***When Case returned to the US and walked through the ruins of her home, the fire that had blazed after these songs were written became part of the record. For the cover, she made a warrior&#39;s helmet out of cigarettes. Interior and exterior shots of her incinerated house appear on the gatefold and booklet. And a tiny pop-open charred Brothers-Grimm cottage serves as the set for the video of &quot;Bad Luck.&quot;It was as if nature invented a landscape for Hell-On after the fact: a melted ladder, seared insulation dangling in ribbons, the internal organs of pianos. She thought it should all be included in solidarity with those who had lost so much in the past year.All the living creatures present at the time of the fire were found alive, and so Case was able see beauty in the bleak scene. &quot;It felt like this out-of-time Jacques Cousteau undersea expedition through a sunken World War II ship. Of course there&#39;s some shit I miss,&quot; she says, citing family photographs and a favorite sweater. &quot;But none of it matters.&quot;And as for those fairy tales she&#39;s writing and the history she&#39;s remembering: &quot;We need them now more than ever. We need stories from all sectors. Stories without endings. Stories with multiple endings. Stories that don&#39;t end happily, cautionary tales, everything. We don&#39;t need Disneyfied stories anymore.&quot;A force of nature, an act of a mercurial, forgotten god, Hell-On is a record sealed by fire, filled with love and rage and dangers that might lay waste to everything at any moment. So if you wake up dazed in a smoking landscape, walking through the detritus of your own lost civilization with the smell of ash in your hair, your favorite sweater gone and a new song in your head, don&#39;t say you weren&#39;t warned.",

		"description": " with King Tuff, Presented by Birmingham Mountain Radio<br> Father John Misty is the brainchild of singer-songwriter Josh Tillman. Tillman has released three widely acclaimed albums Fear Fun (2012), I Love You, Honeybear (2015) and his most recent release, Pure Comedy, his Grammy-nominated album (2017). Father John Misty has also recently contributed to songs by Beyonc and Lady Gaga. As for his most recent album, Pure Comedyit is a complex, often-sardonic, and, equally often, touching meditation on the confounding folly of modern humanity. The album has earned Father John Misty placement on over &quot;50 Best of 2017&quot; lists from Entertainment Weekly, The Guardian, The Sunday Times, Rolling Stone, Stereogum, Pitchfork and more. The reception to Pure Comedy also led to a series of incredible performances with Saturday Night Live,Austin City Limits, the Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Tonight Showand Late Night with Seth Meyers. He recently completed a wildly successful tour in support of the Pure Comedy, and will release its follow up in 2018.",

With the infusion of different genres such as soul, folk and rock, Guthrie brings audiences together through brilliant lyrics and an expressive voice.<p>Most recently, Guthrie has been noted as “the guy from the Jennifer Hudson commercial.” The now-infamous American Family Insurance <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpdKo6JnQJA\" rel=\"nofollow\">commercial</a> features him playing in Atlanta’s Woodruff Park when the Grammy Award-Winning singer and performer Jennifer Hudson surprises Guthrie and sings along to Bill Wither’s beloved “Lovely Day.” The commercial has played on national television and radio, resulting in new opportunities and heightened awareness for Alex Guthrie, his band and his music.<p>Guthrie and his band have performed events including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRrPME6Qu50&feature=youtu.be\" rel=\"nofollow\">Milwaukee’s Summerfest</a> — which was also featured on <a href=\"http://www.jimmykimmellivemusic.com/videos/american-family-insurance-summerfest-recap-4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jimmy Kimmel Live! Music</a> — as well as the 30A Songwriter’s Festival in Florida, Wire and Wood Songwriter Festival in Alpharetta, GA, Jammin’ Java Listening Room in Vienna, VA, the Elbo Room in Chicago, IL and Eddie’s Attic in Atlanta, GA.<p>In the early stages of his career, Guthrie released his first album, <em>Lessons Learned, </em>and also scored the Atlanta Braves Band of the Year in 2014. In 2015, Guthrie and his band were awarded the Georgia Americana Artist of the Year — another astounding achievement bringing his music much-deserved attention and recognition. Within a short span of time, Guthrie was opening up for national touring artists including renowned BMLG Records recording Artist Drake White, RCA recording artist Bleachers, and famous Atlantic Records recording Artist Kelly Clarkson.<p>Singer-songwriter Alex Guthrie continues to impress and defy conventional expectations, making waves as he makes great music. A new album is currently being recorded and is expected to be released in Spring 2018.<p><p><a href=\"http://www.workplay.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_9283.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a>Born in the Philippines, raised in New York, educated in California and now entertaining Birmingham, AL, is one of the hottest musicians rising out of the growing music scene. Lily has built a buzz beyond just Birmingham, and many of those who follow the local music scene mention her as one of those Birmingham gems that is poised to explode onto the national and international scene. Her music mixes R&B, jazz, pop, folk and funk with her superb songwriting talents. She has played venues all over the country and remains busy with an enormous following on newly the emerging streaming platform, Twitch, and YouTube. She is looking to release a new album this year, and has recently released a video for her single, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYYQNdhzxoQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tinder Love</a>”</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>",

		"description": " Time again for all Blues musicians from around the state to enter the Magic City Blues Society - Battle of the Blues Bands. The winners will represent the Magic City Blues Society at the 35th International Blues Challenge (IBC) in Memphis January 22nd – January 26th 2019 when winners from more than 150 Blues societies from around the world will compete. The winner of the IBC will get a lot of sponsorship opportunities and will be booked for some of the most prestigious Blues festivals around the country. Many artists have used this competition to make the national Blues scene. We are looking for the best Blues bands in Alabama to compete in the 2018 Battle of the Blues Bands contest. There will be two first place winners: one band and one solo/duo act. The winners will be booked for paying gigs at MCBS events. The first place winner of the band competition will have their choice to headline the October Phelan Park finale or open up for Blues Ball in December. The second place winner will play the gig that the first place winner does not choose. The third place winner will play for the MCBS birthday party in January 2019. The solo/duo winner will have the option to open the October Phelan Park finale or other MCBS event.<br> Additionally, the MCBS will give a stipend to the winners to assist with the costs of attending the finals in Memphis.<br> Please note:<br> An act my only enter the IBC 3 times. They may not participate 3 consecutive years. A musician may not compete in the band category and the solo/duo in the same year. All members of a winning act must attend the IBC. Acts must enter the challenge of their own/home affiliate first. If they are not successful, they may enter the challenges of no more than 2 affiliates in that year provided those affiliates are within 250 miles of the home affiliate.<br> See here for full details of The Blues foundation Guidelines https://blues.org/international-blues-challenge/#_performers<br> RULES AND SCORING CRITERIA<br> IBC judges are Blues professionals and aficionados with a deep understanding and historical perspective of all blues forms. Any given judge panel will include members with varying opinions of Blues, covering the spectrum of Blues from the most traditional to soul/blues and rock/blues. <br> Scoring Categories and Definitions:<br> •Blues Content: The sound and feel of the music should be true to any of blues sub-categories: traditional blues, country blues, soul blues, blues rock and/or contemporary blues. Judges will be listening for inspired and original song selections or new takes on blues standards. Creative reach is encouraged.<br> •Originality: Original work is encouraged. Cover tunes are allowed but playing the recorded rendition lick by lick is discouraged, will not be looked upon favorably by the judges, and will be reflected in scoring.<br> Acts must indicate if their songs are their own original material (this can be done at the start of the set or before each song as appropriate) and/or identify the covers that they are playing and acknowledge the originator.<br> •Vocals: The act’s vocal skills to include concepts of tone, musicality, meaning, and expression.<br> •Instrumental Talent: Ability level on all instruments featured within the act.<br> •Stage Presence: The ability to command the attention of the audience by the impressiveness of one’s manner and appearance on stage. Judges will consider how an act connects with and engages the audience in the music. Proper use of microphones and amplification will be considered. <br> Basic Scoring Calculation:<br> Judges will score acts on a 10 point scale, with 10 points being the highest score received and 1 point being the lowest. The following weights will be used in calculating final scores:<br> •Raw scores for Blues Content will be multiplied by four<br> •Raw scores for Originality will be multiplied by three<br> •Raw scores for Talent and for Vocals will be multiplied by two<br> •Raw scores for Stage Presence will be multiplied by two<br> The maximum Total Weighted Score an act may receive is 130.<br> Penalty Points: <br> An act will be penalized one point from its Total Weighted Score for each of the following:<br> •Failing to acknowledge that a song is a cover and/or not giving credit to its originator<br> •Each ten seconds that it runs overtime during a competition performance.<br> •Finishing 3 or more minutes before its allotted performance time expires.<br> •Showing up late and/or missing Orientation<br> •Not being ready to perform at stated time<br> SCORING SYSTEM FOR JUDGES<br> Each judge will indicate his or her Raw Score, between 1 and 10, in each category and turn that information over to the Scorekeeper using the following scale:<br> •1-3 – Typical of a beginning blues band<br> •4-5 – Typical of a local weekend band<br> •6-7 – Typical of an advanced local band but not yet ready to headline a major blues club<br> •8-9 – Typical of the quality of blues artists who headline major clubs<br> •10 – Typical of those who play the main stage at major festivals<br> 1.The Scorekeeper will multiply the Raw Score in each category by the established multiplier to get each judge’s Individual Weighted Score in each category for each act.<br> 2.The Individual Weighted Scores for each category will be added together to determine each act’s Total Weighted Score for each judge.<br> 3.Any penalty points assigned will then be deducted from each judge’s Total Weighted Score to obtain the act’s Net Weighted Score for each judge.<br> 4.After all acts have been judged and each act’s Net Weighted Score per judge calculated, each act will be ranked by judge based on that judge’s order of scores, with the act receiving the judge’s highest Net Weighted Score being given a ranking of 1, and so on for that judge. This will reveal each acts Final Ranking Number for each judge.<br> 5.The Scorekeeper then will total the Final Ranking Number from all judges for each act to determine the Gross Final Ranking. This figure is averaged (divided by the total number of judges) to Achieve the Aggregate Act Ranking.<br> 6. The act with the best Aggregate Act Ranking will be the top finisher.<br> 7.In the case of a tie, the Scorekeeper shall calculate the sum of all Net Weighted Scores from all judges for the tied acts. The band with the higher sum of Net Weighted Scores wins.<br> Other Considerations <br> 1. Backline and Equipment<br> The MCBS will provide backline and sound. The setup on stage will include a drum kit with snare drums, amps, keyboards and mics. The backline in will be based on the act’s registration information. Drummers should bring their own cymbals and kick pedals. Harmonica players may (but are not required to) bring their own harp amp. Keyboard players are allowed (but are not required) to bring their own keyboard and keyboard amps. Keyboard stands will be provided. Effects racks and other auxiliary equipment are permitted.

		"description": "Corey Smith, the fan-made man, has sold over 1 million concert tickets, 1.5 million digital singles and over 220,000 albums.  Smith has amassed an unfailingly devout fan base, not only in his native Southeast region, but all around the nation, simply by telling it the way it is.  He has released 10 albums—including 2011’s Top 20 release The Broken Record.  Corey has written every word on every album himself and he produced 9 out of 10 of the records. In Summer 2015, Corey teamed up with producer Keith Stegall (Alan Jackson, Zac Brown Band) for his album, “While the Gettin’ Is Good,” which was released on Sugar Hill Records.  Smith’s concerts, which were documented on his last live record, Live in Chattanooga, regularly sell out, with audiences singing along to such fan favorites as the coming-of-age anthem “Twenty-One,” the nostalgic time warp “If I Could Do It Again” and the group hug “I Love Everyone.”   Corey consistently tours, hitting around 120 dates per year and has begun releasing singles from his upcoming project, the Great Wide Underground.",

		"description": " <br> Like a flood, middle school make out, or amateur adult film, it all began in the basement. The now-famed Yacht Rock Revue was once a band called Y-O-U, pursuing dreams of indie rock fame, when they were given free reign over Thursday nights at 10 High. In the Virginia- Highlands subterranean music lair, they did everything from original tunes to theme sets like Led Zeppelin vs. The Who to comedy (which bombed). But it was the impulse idea to smoothly croon 70s light rock (Hall & Oates, Michael McDonald, Linda Ronstadt, etc.) whilst wearing polyester, aviators, and captains hats that captured the peoples hearts. In early 2008, Yacht Rock became a weekly occurrence; by 2009 the citys cool kids were packing out 10 High on Thursdays nights and tossing back PBRs in their own captains hats, and by 2010, the eight guys (only one of whom has since left the band to join Blackberry Smoke) quit their day jobs and began stockpiling polyester suits.D id the indie rockers dream of being a cover band? About as much as a Rich Girl wants to get a job at Shoneys. But they were tapping into an underserved genre of music, captivating folks both young and old, and their legions of cultish fans are glad they stayed swayed with it. When they finally moved the tunes up to sea level, it was for a holiday show at the Variety Playhouse in 2009. Theyd never heard of a local band renting out the place for a concert, so decided to give it a whirl...and it sold out. Yacht Rock was legit.Larger gigs poured in (corporate events, weddings, Park Tavern) and the band wondered if they could get the very artists they covered to join them on stage while they were out on tour. Spoiler alert: They could (everyone has a price). It started with Walter Egan at a show in Nashville, and they have since shared the stage with Eddie Money, John Oates, and Bobby Kimball from Toto, to name just a few. Theyve played at the Playboy Mansion (obviously), sang the national anthem at the Atlanta Braves game on Fourth of July (complete with Greg and Nick jumping off stage and rounding the bases), opened for Ludacris and Macklemore and Ryan Lewis during the Final Four, sailed on music cruises with Kid Rock, Train, Heart, Weezer, and Kiss (for the record, they do NOT drive the boat), and have packed out shows in NYC, Nashville, Los Angeles, and more. The guys (who actually like each other in real life) have developed a flawless, signature style with spot-on renditions, refreshing comedy, and energetic stage presence any band would covet. Theyve received accolades like Best Place to Get Drunk With Your Dad to Best Overall Music Act in Atlanta to Best Place to Start an Extramarital Affair, and have been name-dropped by the New York Times, Pitchfork, the Guardian UK, Spin, TimeOut New York, Billboard, MTV.com, and (probably) your mom at her last Tupperware party.And its not always pure AM Gold glory, as they perform under many aliases: Please PleaseRock Me (Beatles), Reagan Rock (Smooth 80s) Uno Dos Tres Catorce (U2), Dazed and Confused (&#39;70s Stoner Rock), Rock Fight (Led Zeppelin vs. the Who, Tom Petty vs. Fleetwood Mac, etc.) and so forth. Yacht Rock Revue also performs many classic albums in their entirety, including Michael Jackson&#39;s Thriller, Pink Floyd&#39;s Dark Side of the Moon, Prince&#39;s Purple Rain, the Beatles&#39; Sgt. Pepper&#39;s Lonely Hearts Club Band, XTC&#39;s Black Sea, and Led Zeppelin IV. But no matter what theyre playing, its always a license to let loose. Smooth rock on, yall.",

		"description": " <br> &quot;The road goes on forever ...&quot;It&#39;s not always easy to sum up a career - let alone a life&#39;s ambition - so succinctly, but those five words from Robert Earl Keen&#39;s calling-card anthem just about do it. You can complete the lyric with the next five words - the ones routinely shouted back at Keen by thousands of fans a night (&quot;and the party never ends!&quot;) - just to punctuate the point with a flourish, but it&#39;s the part about the journey that gets right to the heart of what makes Keen tick. Some people take up a life of playing music with the goal of someday reaching a destination of fame and fortune; but from the get-go, Keen just wanted to write and sing his own songs, and to keep writing and singing them for as long as possible.&quot;I always thought that I wanted to play music, and I always knew that you had to get some recognition in order to continue to play music,&quot; Keen says. &quot;But I never thought of it in terms of getting to be a big star. I thought of it in terms of having a really, really good career and writing some good songs, and getting onstage and having a really good time.&quot;Now three-decades on from the release of his debut album - with eighteen other records to his name, thousands of shows under his belt and still no end in sight to the road ahead - Keen remains as committed to and inspired by his muse as ever. And as for accruing recognition, well, he&#39;s done alright on that front, too; from his humble beginnings on the Texas folk scene, he&#39;s blazed a peer, critic, and fan-lauded trail that&#39;s earned him living-legend (not to mention pioneer) status in the Americana music world. And though the Houston native has never worn his Texas heart on his sleeve, he&#39;s long been regarded as one of the Lone Star State&#39;s finest (not to mention top-drawing) true singer-songwriters. He was still a relative unknown in 1989 when his third studio album, West Textures, was released - especially on the triple bill he shared at the time touring with legends Townes Van Zandt and Guy Clark - but once fellow Texas icon Joe Ely recorded both &quot;The Road Goes on Forever&quot; and &quot;Whenever Kindness Fails&quot; on his 1993 album, Love and Danger, the secret was out on Keen&#39;s credentials as a songwriter&#39;s songwriter. By the end of the decade, Keen was a veritable household name in Texas, headlining a millennial New Year&#39;s Eve celebration in Austin that drew an estimated 200,000 people. A dozen years later, he was inducted into the Texas Heritage Songwriters Hall of Fame along with the late, great Van Zandt and his longtime friend from Texas A & M, Lyle Lovett.The middle child of a geologist father and an attorney mother, Keen was weaned on classic rock (in particular, the psychedelic blues trio Cream) and his older brother&#39;s Willie Nelson records - but it was his younger sister&#39;s downtown Houston celebrity status as a &quot;world-champion foosball player&quot; that exposed him to the area&#39;s acoustic folk scene. By the time he started working on his English degree at Texas A&M, he was teaching himself guitar and setting his poetic musings to song. That in turn led to a college fling with a bluegrass ensemble (featuring his childhood friend Bryan Duckworth, who would continue to play fiddle with Keen well into the &#39;90s) and front-porch picking parties with fellow Aggie Lovett at Keen&#39;s rental house - salad days captured in spirit on the Keen/Lovett co-write, &quot;The Front Porch Song,&quot; which both artists would eventually record on their respective debut albums.While Lovett&#39;s self-titled debut was released on major-label Curb Records, Keen took the road less travelled, self-financing and producing 1984&#39;s No Kinda Dancer and leasing it to the independent label Rounder Records, which issued it on its Philo imprint. &quot;It was difficult, because I didn&#39;t know what I was doing ... I literally opened up the phonebook and looked for studios,&quot; Keen recalls. &quot;I basically put it all together through brute force and ignorance, but I was shocked with how well it worked out and very happy with it. We had a release party at Butch Hancock&#39;s Dixie Bar and Bustop, and Lyle and Nanci Griffith and a lot of those people who were a part of the Austin folkie scene came out.&quot;Keen himself had already started to make quite a name for himself on that scene, thanks to four years of constant regional gigging and winning the Kerrville Folk Festival&#39;s prestigious New Folk songwriting competition in 1983. After his debut&#39;s release, he began touring more and more outside of the state lines, eventually moving to Nashville in 1986. Keen&#39;s stint in Music City, U.S.A., lasted just under two years, but he returned to Texas armed with a publishing deal, a new label (another indie, Sugar Hill), and a national booking agent. He closed the decade with 1988&#39;s The Live Album and the following year&#39;s West Textures, the album that marked the debut of &quot;The Road Goes on Forever&quot; and, not inconsequently, kicked his career into high gear.With hindsight, Keen admits he no idea at the time of writing it that his song about a couple of ill-fated lovers running afoul of the law would have the legs it did, but he readily points to the forward thinking of DJ Steve Coffman of San Antonio radio station KRIO for helping to start the fire. &quot;He talked the station into doing sort of a free-form programing format, basically anything he liked, which turned out to be some Texas music along with a lot of cool sort of pop music,&quot; he says. &quot;So all of a sudden, I heard my song back-to-back with the Sheryl Crow song that was popular at the time, and that was the first time that I really felt like I was a real part of the music business, despite having been in it already for a pretty long time. And right after that, I went to a show in San Antonio and there were 1,500 people there - whereas up to that point I&#39;d been playing to, max, maybe 150. That was the real ah-hah moment for me that really got me going and kept me going, because before that I&#39;d been doing this for eight or 10 years and had a lot of rejection but very little success.&quot;After that, though, success came in spades. Although he continued to steer clear of the Garth Brooks-dominated waters of the country mainstream, the perfect storm of Keen&#39;s literate song craft, razor wit and killer band (more on that in a bit) stirred up a grassroots sensation in Texas not seen since the &#39;70s heyday of maverick &quot;outlaw country&quot; upstarts Willie, Waylon, and Jerry Jeff Walker. Armed with two more albums (1993&#39;s A Bigger Piece of Sky and &#39;94&#39;s Gringo Honeymoon) brimming with instant classics like &quot;Corpus Christi Bay,&quot; &quot;Whenever Kindness Fails,&quot; &quot;Gringo Honeymoon,&quot; &quot;Dreadful Selfish Crime&quot; and &quot;Merry Christmas From the Family,&quot; he began packing dancehalls, roadhouses, theaters, and festival grounds with diverse crowds of rowdy college kids, serious singer-songwriter fans and plenty of folks who, like Keen himself, had been around the Texas music scene long enough to remember Willie&#39;s earliest 4th of July Picnics. And the phenomenon was not confined to the Texas state lines. Famed producer and pedal steel ace Lloyd Maines (Joe Ely, Terry Allen) helped Keen and his band bottle lighting on 1996&#39;s No. 2 Live Dinner, a next-best-thing-to-being-there concert document that remains one of Keen&#39;s best-selling albums, and the burgeoning Americana music scene (bolstered by AAA radio stations across the country and magazines like No Depression) embraced Keen as one of its prime movers. In the wake of albums like 1997&#39;s Picnic and &#39;98&#39;s Walking Distance (both released on major-label Arista), one would have been hard-pressed to tell the difference between a rabid Robert Earl Keen crowd at Texas&#39; legendary Gruene Hall and those at New York City joints like Tramps and the Bowery Ballroom. Little wonder, then, that when the songwriter-revering &quot;Americana&quot; style was officially recognized by the industry 1998, Keen was the genre&#39;s first artist to be featured on the cover of the radio trade magazine Gavin.The &#39;90s may have been a boom period for Keen, but his momentum hasn&#39;t ebbed a bit since the turn of the century - nor has his pursuit of continued growth as a writer and artist. If anything, his output from the last decade has been marked by some of the most adventurous music of his career. &quot;Wild Wind,&quot; an unforgettable highlight from Gravitational Forces, his Gurf Morlix-produced 2001 debut for the Nashville-based Americana label Lost Highway, captured the character (and characters) of a small Texas town with a cinematic eye reminiscent of The Last Picture Show; but the album&#39;s title track also found Keen wryly experimenting with spacey, beatnik jazz. For the freewheelin&#39;, freak-flag-flying Farm Fresh Onions (2003, Audium/Koch), Keen and producer Rich Brotherton (his longtime guitarist) took the band into the proverbial garage to knock out their most rocking set of songs to date - most notably the psychedelic rave-up of the title track. Brotherton also produced the more rootsy but equally playful What I Really Mean (2005, E1 Music), but Lloyd Maines was back at the helm for 2009&#39;s eclectic The Rose Hotel and 2011&#39;s spirited Ready for Confetti (both released by Lost Highway). The later was especially well received by fans and critics alike, with AllMusic&#39;s Thom Jurek raving, &quot;Ready for Confetti is, without question, Keen&#39;s most inspired and focused project in nearly 20 years.&quot; His latest project released in 2015, &quot;Happy Prisoner: The Bluegrass Sessions&quot; was a straight -ahead &quot;love postcard to bluegrass&quot;. This was something Keen had wanted to do for a long time and it was now or never. Keen is ranked Billboard&#39;s No. 2, 2015 Bluegrass Artist of the year. His current recording, Happy Prisoner: The Bluegrass Sessions, charted as 2015&#39;s Top 5 album at Americana Radio and Billboard&#39;s 2015 No. 2 album on the Bluegrass Albums chart.Earlier this year, Keen played three weeks of sold-out theater dates with Lyle Lovett, just two longtime college friends swapping songs on acoustic guitars like they used to do on Keen&#39;s front porch in College Station. But the lion&#39;s share of his concert schedule still finds him playing full-tilt with his seasoned road and studio band: Brotherton on guitar, Bill Whitbeck on bass, Tom Van Schaik on drums, and Marty Muse on steel guitar. &quot;I&#39;ve been with this band for 20 years now,&quot; Keen says proudly. &quot;I used to think that was just sort of an interesting fact, but now it&#39;s almost a total anomaly - that just doesn&#39;t happen much. I always felt like once you lock into the right bunch of people, you try to do the best by them that you can. So we&#39;ve been able to stay together a long time, and I think one thing that makes it worthwhile for people to come see us as an act is the fact that it&#39;s not like we&#39;re trying to work it all out onstage - we&#39;ve already worked everything out.&quot;REK has had the honor of working with music legends Dave Matthews, Bonnie Raitt, Sheryl Crow, Eric Church, Gary Clark, Jr. among others. He was inducted into the Texas Heritage Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2012. In March 2015, Robert Earl Keen was recognized as the first recipient of BMI&#39;s official Troubadour Award. Keen is an active member of NARAS and was invited to be a participant in the prestigious &quot;Grammys On The Hill&quot; where he sang the National Anthem at the opening ceremony and was a member of the delegation that lobbied US Congress to support musicians&#39; rights, specifically the &quot;Fair Pay for Fair Play Act&quot;.But the road goes on and on, with no time for resting on laurels. Not that Keen&#39;s complaining. &quot;I had a relatively open schedule for 2016 back at the beginning of the year, but it has just filled in like you wouldn&#39;t believe,&quot; he marvels during a rare day off in Kerrville, Texas (where he lives with his wife and two daughters). &quot;I&#39;ve broke my record this year - I&#39;ve packed for five trips at one time, because I wasn&#39;t going to be starting any of them in the same place. It&#39;s been crazy!It isn&#39;t always easy being Robert Earl Keen, but somebody&#39;s got to do it. And now more than ever, he&#39;s up to the task and loving every minute of it.",

		"description": " with Cory Branan<br> Amanda Shires is not an entertainer. She isnt looking to help listeners escape their everyday lives or soundtrack celebrations. She isnt reaching for celebrity, and she isnt concerned with cultivating a personal brand. She is an artist in the true sense of the word, meaning she creates because she has a real need for the process of creating. That is not to say that the songs on My Piece Of Landarent entertaining, but that quality is a by-product. The real intention here is to relate. Ms. Shires began her career as a teenager playing fiddle with the Texas Playboys. Since then, shes toured and recorded with John Prine, Billy Joe Shaver, Todd Snider, Justin Townes Earle, Shovels & Rope, and most recently her husband Jason Isbell. Along the way shes made three solo albums, each serving to document a particular period in her life while improving on the perceptive qualities of the previous record. The songs on My Piece Of Land deal with family, with anxiety, with the phases of one young womans life; but the primary focus of My Piece Of Landis the concept of home. Ms. Shires addresses the similarities and differences between the home she was born into, the two homes she was eventually split between, and the home she has finally made for herself. Some of these stories are from the creators point of view and some most certainly are not. Youd be hard-pressed to identify which is which, though, considering the level of empathy involved in the creation of these stories. The concept of home, like the concept of love, is more complex than it seems, says Ms. Shires. You start out with this inherited idea of home, but as you grow you realize thats only a suggestion. You have to use that along with all the little pieces of wisdom youve picked up along the way to finally build your own place in the world. Ms. Shires sometimes describes songwriting as solving the puzzles, but before the songwriter even begins to arrange rhymes and melodies, she must first be acquainted with the complicated workings of the heart. Most of this album was written after Ms. Shires had reached the seven-month point in a summertime pregnancy, and was no longer able to travel. For a woman used to touring most of the year, being stuck inside brought challenges and offered creative rewards. Pregnancy does weird things to you, Amanda says. You walk around holding your arms over your belly, sometimes almost overcome by anxiety. I constantly wondered if I would be able to protect this child, if my marriage would last forever, if Id learned enough about the world to be a good mother. At the same time, youre so excited, so hopeful, and so severely physically limited. About how the setting affected the finished product, she says This record turned out to be a personal record, set in our home where I had lots of time for reflection and time to face my concerns and fears. The listener can hear Ms. Shires unpacking those anxieties in a song like Slippin, with its ruminations on what could go wrong in a relationship that seems stable. Therell be a trigger,then up starts the fire,a handful of matchessome faulty wiring.Youll say you have this hollow feeling. Somethings always been missing. Tonight could be the night you go slippin&#39; away from me. Her piece of land is one with a panoramic view, and she pays close attention to even the smallest details. Take, for instance, the first stanza of Harmless. A phased golden light rained down from the streetlight. It fell across your shoulder, paused just above your collar. With this description of one fleeting moment, the writer sets an entire scene. Ms. Shireswould argue that the term poet should not be used to mean unusually perceptive songwriter, since the roles of modern songwriter and poet are so very different. However, it isnt hard to understand how her post-graduate education in poetry helps Ms. Shires choose which details to include. Its all about precision. My time in the MFA (Master Of Fine Arts) program at Sewanee taught me a lot about different ways of writing and how they all have one thing in common: the better you are at editing, the better your work will be. Spending long hours workshopping poems and reading the classics gave me a solid standard when it came time to edit my songs. Ms. Shires recorded My Piece Of Land under the guidance of brilliant Nashville producer Dave Cobb at his Low Country Sound studio. Inviting Cobb to produceMy Piece Of Landwas an easy decision to make, considering Ms. Shires had worked with him before on Jason Isbell&#39;s albums Southeastern and Something More Than Free. Ms. Shires knew of Daves propensity toward arranging the songs in-studio, rather than rehearsing or making demos beforehand. Cobb believes in the spontaneity of early takes, and with the proficient rhythm section of Paul Slivka and Paul Griffith, the studio band was able to record the album in a relatively short amount of time without sacrificing performance quality. This approach gives each song on the album emotional urgency along with a groove thats loose and effortless. Among other things, Pale Fire is about consciously shifting ones own priorities. There are two types of lovers: the kind we need and the kind we want. The hard part is finding someone who represents both. You Are My Home is written as a gift, a token of appreciation to someone who has helped the narrator define her place in the world. Mineral Wells is a song Ms. Shires wrote many years ago, after relocating to Nashville from her childhood home in Texas. It speaks to the part of us that never really leaves that original homeplace. With My Piece Of Land, you get the sense that Amanda Shires has reached a personal pinnacle. This album is the creative milestone suited to accompany the recent milestones in her life: becoming a mother, developing into a true artist, and finally finding a home.",

		"description": " <br> Sacramento, CA alternative hip-hop artist Hobo Johnson is Frank Lopes Jr; often backed by his bandmates The Lovemakers. In November 2017, Hobo Johnson released the record The Rise of Hobo Johnson, which Frank wrote during a time he had to live out of his &#39;94 Toyota Corolla - hence his self-given pseudonym. On April 17, 2018, Hobo Johnson released the highly-anticipated single &quot;Peach Scone&quot; (both the studio and live version), which debuted on Spotifys New Music Friday. (Listen to &quot;Peach Scone&quot; here.) The new single comes on the heels of Hobo Johnson&#39;s &quot;Peach Scone&quot; live performance video, which was posted online as a submission for NPRs Tiny Desk contest. The live video of that unreleased track got Hobo Johnson much more than expected. In just 7 weeks, the &quot;Peach Scone&quot; video racked up over 14.6 million views on Facebook and YouTube. Across all socials, their followers have grown from 10,000 total to well over one million followers. Their fervent new fans boosted the 2017 The Rise of Hobo Johnson album to #8 on the iTunes Hip-Hop chart and #11 on Billboard&#39;s Heatseekers chart. Hobo Johnson has also caught the attention of big media players like MTV who tweeted &quot;Very much in love with @_hobojohnson&quot; and a feature from Perez Hilton and The Needle Drop. Five different songs from The Rise of Hobo Johnson have charted on Spotify&#39;s Global Viral 50, US Viral 50, Australia Viral 50, UK Viral 50, Canada Viral 50, Philippines Viral 50, Spain Viral 50, NZ Viral 50, Ireland Viral 50, Netherlands Viral 50. It has also appeared on on Spotify&#39;s Tear Drop, Viral Hits Canada, Viral Hits AUS & NZ. This year, fans can look forward to more US and international tour dates from Hobo Johnson & The Lovemakers.",

		"description": " with Cory Branan<br> Amanda Shires is not an entertainer. She isnt looking to help listeners escape their everyday lives or soundtrack celebrations. She isnt reaching for celebrity, and she isnt concerned with cultivating a personal brand. She is an artist in the true sense of the word, meaning she creates because she has a real need for the process of creating. That is not to say that the songs on My Piece Of Landarent entertaining, but that quality is a by-product. The real intention here is to relate. Ms. Shires began her career as a teenager playing fiddle with the Texas Playboys. Since then, shes toured and recorded with John Prine, Billy Joe Shaver, Todd Snider, Justin Townes Earle, Shovels & Rope, and most recently her husband Jason Isbell. Along the way shes made three solo albums, each serving to document a particular period in her life while improving on the perceptive qualities of the previous record. The songs on My Piece Of Land deal with family, with anxiety, with the phases of one young womans life; but the primary focus of My Piece Of Landis the concept of home. Ms. Shires addresses the similarities and differences between the home she was born into, the two homes she was eventually split between, and the home she has finally made for herself. Some of these stories are from the creators point of view and some most certainly are not. Youd be hard-pressed to identify which is which, though, considering the level of empathy involved in the creation of these stories. The concept of home, like the concept of love, is more complex than it seems, says Ms. Shires. You start out with this inherited idea of home, but as you grow you realize thats only a suggestion. You have to use that along with all the little pieces of wisdom youve picked up along the way to finally build your own place in the world. Ms. Shires sometimes describes songwriting as solving the puzzles, but before the songwriter even begins to arrange rhymes and melodies, she must first be acquainted with the complicated workings of the heart. Most of this album was written after Ms. Shires had reached the seven-month point in a summertime pregnancy, and was no longer able to travel. For a woman used to touring most of the year, being stuck inside brought challenges and offered creative rewards. Pregnancy does weird things to you, Amanda says. You walk around holding your arms over your belly, sometimes almost overcome by anxiety. I constantly wondered if I would be able to protect this child, if my marriage would last forever, if Id learned enough about the world to be a good mother. At the same time, youre so excited, so hopeful, and so severely physically limited. About how the setting affected the finished product, she says This record turned out to be a personal record, set in our home where I had lots of time for reflection and time to face my concerns and fears. The listener can hear Ms. Shires unpacking those anxieties in a song like Slippin, with its ruminations on what could go wrong in a relationship that seems stable. Therell be a trigger,then up starts the fire,a handful of matchessome faulty wiring.Youll say you have this hollow feeling. Somethings always been missing. Tonight could be the night you go slippin&#39; away from me. Her piece of land is one with a panoramic view, and she pays close attention to even the smallest details. Take, for instance, the first stanza of Harmless. A phased golden light rained down from the streetlight. It fell across your shoulder, paused just above your collar. With this description of one fleeting moment, the writer sets an entire scene. Ms. Shireswould argue that the term poet should not be used to mean unusually perceptive songwriter, since the roles of modern songwriter and poet are so very different. However, it isnt hard to understand how her post-graduate education in poetry helps Ms. Shires choose which details to include. Its all about precision. My time in the MFA (Master Of Fine Arts) program at Sewanee taught me a lot about different ways of writing and how they all have one thing in common: the better you are at editing, the better your work will be. Spending long hours workshopping poems and reading the classics gave me a solid standard when it came time to edit my songs. Ms. Shires recorded My Piece Of Land under the guidance of brilliant Nashville producer Dave Cobb at his Low Country Sound studio. Inviting Cobb to produceMy Piece Of Landwas an easy decision to make, considering Ms. Shires had worked with him before on Jason Isbell&#39;s albums Southeastern and Something More Than Free. Ms. Shires knew of Daves propensity toward arranging the songs in-studio, rather than rehearsing or making demos beforehand. Cobb believes in the spontaneity of early takes, and with the proficient rhythm section of Paul Slivka and Paul Griffith, the studio band was able to record the album in a relatively short amount of time without sacrificing performance quality. This approach gives each song on the album emotional urgency along with a groove thats loose and effortless. Among other things, Pale Fire is about consciously shifting ones own priorities. There are two types of lovers: the kind we need and the kind we want. The hard part is finding someone who represents both. You Are My Home is written as a gift, a token of appreciation to someone who has helped the narrator define her place in the world. Mineral Wells is a song Ms. Shires wrote many years ago, after relocating to Nashville from her childhood home in Texas. It speaks to the part of us that never really leaves that original homeplace. With My Piece Of Land, you get the sense that Amanda Shires has reached a personal pinnacle. This album is the creative milestone suited to accompany the recent milestones in her life: becoming a mother, developing into a true artist, and finally finding a home.",

		"description": " with Snacks<br> Iceage is Elias Bender Rnnenfelt, Dan Kjr Nielsen, Johan Suurballe Wieth, and Jakob Tvilling Pless. Beyondless, Iceages fourth record (and first that was recorded all-analog), was produced by the band and Nis Bysted, recorded by Mattias Glav at Kungsten Studios Gteberg, and mixed by Randall Dunn at Avast Studios Seattle. The album was played entirely by the band with additional performances by Nils Grndhal (violin), horns by Kasper Tranberg (trumpet), Lars Greve (saxophones) and Morten Jessen (trombone), and vocals on Pain Killer by Sky Ferreira.Below please find further words on this moving, majestic new album and its nuanced craftsmanship from Daniel Stewart (Total Control) and Richard Hell.-The beauty of a moral act depends on the beauty of its expression. To say that it is beautiful is to decide that it will be so. It remains to be proved so. This is the task of images, that is, of the correspondences with the physical world. The act is beautiful if it provokes, and in our throat reveals, song. Sometimes the consciousness with which we have pondered a reputedly vile act, the power of expression which must signify it, impels us to song. This means that treachery is beautiful if it makes us sing.-Genet, A Thiefs JournalBeyondless is the 4th LP from Iceage. This record radiates joy.Pay attention to the journey, from New Brigade, a juvenile delinquent take on post-punk, full of cold, distant condemnation, and onto the ecstasy of Youre Nothing, shedding the more aggressive hardcore influence and dragging in more light, a tendency followed on Plowing Into The Field Of Love. The intoxication is consistent, this has always been drunk music, but its less a stumbling confusion and more a sturdy heartfelt confession with each record. They have finally caught up with their ambition. Their entire charm has always rested in their running ahead of themselves with blind confidence, taunting you to follow and you follow because wherever they are going is vital, is alive; on Beyondless they are treading with an assurance that is disarming, but there is no loss of charm, you are arm in arm now, whispering intimacies.Intimacies that recall other intimacies: something must have happened when Iceage heard Gun Club Miami. Some traumatic event! A wild band has not been tamed, but is in repose, retaining an edge but expressing something less definite, something about hurt or longing or regret.Attention must be directed toward the brilliance of EBRs lyricism on Beyondless! In his evocations of beauty in profane imagery, in his plumbing of the depths of betrayal and criminality, there are suggestions of Jean Genet and the disgraceful slurring of Leonard Cohen.Loves Forever Changes is an appropriate reference point for the record, orchestral touches to rock music that reached in a very affected / effected manner toward some transcendent experience. You can hear blissful catatonic evocations of the Waterboys, slurring face down on the bar some holy affirmations. Overall, the strongest suggestion is of the Stones in their Exile period, holed up in some decadent mansion attempting to pay tribute to American music from country honk brawls to sleazy soul revues to cocaine blues, it has this confident air of music written in the midst of excessive reveries.Letting in the light, the joy radiates. They are post post-punk, Beyondless retains the rich character of their brash beginnings, but this is something beyond, oh hell, this is something very, very special, a generous gift for an anemic age.-Daniel Stewart (Total Control)-THE NEW ICEAGEby Richard HellI can totally imagine myself as a kid lying in my closed-door room in the dark, listening to this band and getting what I need, the way a band can make a person feel seen and bring confidence, sometimes even represent an ideal. Or maybe Im already all defiant and self-certain, and I identify with Iceage because they are too, and theyre who I want to represent me in music. Its a weird combination of qualities that a rock and roll band and their recordings presents to their young crowd, imparts to them. The music being pure emotion, the strong emotions of youthanger, sadness, contempt, longingas well as energy and sex, and the bands demonstration that it gracefully owns and provides those things, consoling their followers in all the confusion.What is it that Iceage in particular brings? A large number of extraordinary things. (Poetry! But more about that later.) The band members were childhood friends, which is always good news. Theyre like a small urban gang, faithful to each other, suspicious of outsiders (of which music journalists like me are the most suspect examples). At the same time, they seem mature and competent, which is almost too much to hope for. They not only play and compose well, but the production of their records, from the very beginning, and at the musics most chaotic, is impeccable. Their presentation is as hardcore anarchic as any, but much better played, mixed, and recorded than most.And then theres the poetry and the intelligence. The members of Iceage are not only smart but hyper literate. Interviews with E. Rnnenfelt, the lead singer and lyricist of the band, find him mentioning Carson McCullers, The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter; Georges Bataille, Story of the Eye; Peter Shaffers Equus; Mishima, The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea; Genets Thiefs Journal and Miracle of the Rose; The Torture Garden by Octave Mirbeau; Henry Miller on Writing; and James Agees A Death in the Family, and thats in a total of four interviews. Its not that he flaunts it; hes simply honest and naturally acknowledges it.The lyrics of Iceage songs have the most sophisticated vocabulary I can remember finding in rock music. Heres a favorite example, from Pain Killer (ft Sky Ferreira) on the new album:Praying at the altar of your legs and feetYour saliva is a drug so bittersweetIll arrogate whats there to takeIn an evanescent embraceArrogate??? I half know the word, but I had to look it up to be certain. It means to claim or seize without justification. Its funny because its Latin root also underlies the word arrogant, which one might be tempted to apply to Rnnenfelt for the contempt he shows for people who try to understand him. But I sympathize. It is extremely annoying to be characterized by other people. And the shading of meaning of the word arrogate brings a subtlety to those lyrics of his that take or seize or claim wouldnt. Frankly, though, what I really like about those lines is the concept of praying to his lovers feet. Thats good. It makes me think of a similar instance in another poet, Charles Baudelaire, who wrote in his Hymn to Beauty:Who cares if you come from paradise or hell,appalling Beauty, artless and monstrous scourge,if only your eyes, your smile or your foot revealthe infinite I love and have never known?",

		"description": " with KinZie<br> Is it possible to be nostalgic for the future? Brooklyn synthpop duo Great Good Fine Ok met one evening in 2013 and by the next morning had written their first song together, &quot;You&#39;re the One for Me,&quot; a gauzy, heart-thumping anthem that hit #1 on Hype Machine twice in one month and instantly established the group&#39;s sound with Jon Sandler&#39;s dancefloor falsetto soaring over Luke Moellman&#39;s lush post-Space Age production, the perfect soundtrack for retrofuturism. An EP, Body Diamond, soon followed, as did a slate of shows at that year&#39;s SXSW festival and a deal with Neon Gold and Epic Records. In 2014 GGFO&#39;s second EP, 2M2H, reached #10 on the iTunes dance chart and featured the St. Lucia collaboration &quot;Something to Believe In,&quot; which premiered on Entertainment Weekly. In keeping with this collaborative spirit, GGFO co-wrote and performed on The Chainsmoker&#39;s single &quot;Let You Go,&quot; recorded a cover of Phil Collins&#39;s &quot;Easy Lover&quot; with fellow Brooklynite Panama Wedding, and produced the song &quot;Shapeshifting&quot; with Irish folk-pop singer Orla Gartland, whom Jon and Luke met after their headlining show at Notting Hill Arts Club in London. They have also remixed songs by St Lucia, Foxes, Twenty One Pilots, Luxley, Little Daylight, and many others.In the past three years, GGFO have performed shows supporting acts ranging from Tove Lo to X Ambassadors to Penguin Prison and have embarked on four major US tours with Betty Who, Joywave, Magic Man, Vacationer, and Panama Wedding, with four songs reaching #1 on Hype Machine and their single &quot;Take It or Leave It&quot; surpassing ten million plays on Spotify. As anyone who attended the group&#39;s recent sold-out Northeast headlining tour can attest, GGFO has amassed a large contingent of loyal fans who have come to expect over-the-top live performances involving silk kimonos, triggered lights, and histrionic keytar solos, with Jon and Luke backed by drummer Danny Wolf and guitarist Carey Clayton. 2016 has already seen the release of three singles and an EP of GGFO songs remixed by like-minded artists, with more new works ever looming on the horizon. Music blog Indie Shuffle says, &quot;I dare you to find another group in the past two years who has been so prolific and consistent with their releases while at the same time delivering some of the most heavenly signature falsetto vocals known to man.&quot;",

		"description": " <br> Like a flood, middle school make out, or amateur adult film, it all began in the basement. The now-famed Yacht Rock Revue was once a band called Y-O-U, pursuing dreams of indie rock fame, when they were given free reign over Thursday nights at 10 High. In the Virginia- Highlands subterranean music lair, they did everything from original tunes to theme sets like Led Zeppelin vs. The Who to comedy (which bombed). But it was the impulse idea to smoothly croon 70s light rock (Hall & Oates, Michael McDonald, Linda Ronstadt, etc.) whilst wearing polyester, aviators, and captains hats that captured the peoples hearts. In early 2008, Yacht Rock became a weekly occurrence; by 2009 the citys cool kids were packing out 10 High on Thursdays nights and tossing back PBRs in their own captains hats, and by 2010, the eight guys (only one of whom has since left the band to join Blackberry Smoke) quit their day jobs and began stockpiling polyester suits.D id the indie rockers dream of being a cover band? About as much as a Rich Girl wants to get a job at Shoneys. But they were tapping into an underserved genre of music, captivating folks both young and old, and their legions of cultish fans are glad they stayed swayed with it. When they finally moved the tunes up to sea level, it was for a holiday show at the Variety Playhouse in 2009. Theyd never heard of a local band renting out the place for a concert, so decided to give it a whirl...and it sold out. Yacht Rock was legit.Larger gigs poured in (corporate events, weddings, Park Tavern) and the band wondered if they could get the very artists they covered to join them on stage while they were out on tour. Spoiler alert: They could (everyone has a price). It started with Walter Egan at a show in Nashville, and they have since shared the stage with Eddie Money, John Oates, and Bobby Kimball from Toto, to name just a few. Theyve played at the Playboy Mansion (obviously), sang the national anthem at the Atlanta Braves game on Fourth of July (complete with Greg and Nick jumping off stage and rounding the bases), opened for Ludacris and Macklemore and Ryan Lewis during the Final Four, sailed on music cruises with Kid Rock, Train, Heart, Weezer, and Kiss (for the record, they do NOT drive the boat), and have packed out shows in NYC, Nashville, Los Angeles, and more. The guys (who actually like each other in real life) have developed a flawless, signature style with spot-on renditions, refreshing comedy, and energetic stage presence any band would covet. Theyve received accolades like Best Place to Get Drunk With Your Dad to Best Overall Music Act in Atlanta to Best Place to Start an Extramarital Affair, and have been name-dropped by the New York Times, Pitchfork, the Guardian UK, Spin, TimeOut New York, Billboard, MTV.com, and (probably) your mom at her last Tupperware party.And its not always pure AM Gold glory, as they perform under many aliases: Please PleaseRock Me (Beatles), Reagan Rock (Smooth 80s) Uno Dos Tres Catorce (U2), Dazed and Confused (&#39;70s Stoner Rock), Rock Fight (Led Zeppelin vs. the Who, Tom Petty vs. Fleetwood Mac, etc.) and so forth. Yacht Rock Revue also performs many classic albums in their entirety, including Michael Jackson&#39;s Thriller, Pink Floyd&#39;s Dark Side of the Moon, Prince&#39;s Purple Rain, the Beatles&#39; Sgt. Pepper&#39;s Lonely Hearts Club Band, XTC&#39;s Black Sea, and Led Zeppelin IV. But no matter what theyre playing, its always a license to let loose. Smooth rock on, yall.",

		"description": " <p><a href=\"http://www.workplay.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MRYGLD.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a><p>MRYGLD (pronounced ‘marigold’) is a rock band from Birmingham, Alabama formed in 2017 by Brandon Snipes (vocals, guitar) and Shane Jewell (lead guitar). Brandishing infectious melodies, arena-ready guitar riffs and driving rhythms, their sound is further distinguished by having two lead singers: Snipes and Alyssa Jewell (vocals, keys).<p>The Jewells met Snipes in 2015 when they saw him play at a local music festival. A conversation after the show led to instant chemistry over shared musical tastes. After over a year of playing shows together with their respective bands, B. Snipes and Crimson Cabins, they decided to form an epic rock band. After recruiting Kyle Blair (drums) and James McCauley (bass) the lineup was set and MRYGLD was born.<p> </p></p></p></p>",

Emma Ruth Rundle will be performing solo June 8th through 14th, Alexis Marshall (of the band Daughters) will be reading from his book as well as other poems June 9th through June 14th, and Null from Birmingham Alabama (members of Coliseum) will be performing June 15th through 21st. Looking forward.Young Widows&#39; bruising 2006 debut, Settle Down City, introduced the Louisville, KY trio as an ugly force to be reckoned with. Two years later they dropped Old Wounds, their sophomore stomp that inspired at least a dozen imitators of varying degrees of success. From there the band traded some of their trademark fury for the bleak, widescreen atmospheres of In and Out of Youth and Lightness. Now, three years later, Young Widows meld the strengths of their past and their tenacity for the future to forge Easy Pain, an album perfectly befitting their merciless moniker.",

		"description": " <br> &quot;The road goes on forever ...&quot;It&#39;s not always easy to sum up a career - let alone a life&#39;s ambition - so succinctly, but those five words from Robert Earl Keen&#39;s calling-card anthem just about do it. You can complete the lyric with the next five words - the ones routinely shouted back at Keen by thousands of fans a night (&quot;and the party never ends!&quot;) - just to punctuate the point with a flourish, but it&#39;s the part about the journey that gets right to the heart of what makes Keen tick. Some people take up a life of playing music with the goal of someday reaching a destination of fame and fortune; but from the get-go, Keen just wanted to write and sing his own songs, and to keep writing and singing them for as long as possible.&quot;I always thought that I wanted to play music, and I always knew that you had to get some recognition in order to continue to play music,&quot; Keen says. &quot;But I never thought of it in terms of getting to be a big star. I thought of it in terms of having a really, really good career and writing some good songs, and getting onstage and having a really good time.&quot;Now three-decades on from the release of his debut album - with eighteen other records to his name, thousands of shows under his belt and still no end in sight to the road ahead - Keen remains as committed to and inspired by his muse as ever. And as for accruing recognition, well, he&#39;s done alright on that front, too; from his humble beginnings on the Texas folk scene, he&#39;s blazed a peer, critic, and fan-lauded trail that&#39;s earned him living-legend (not to mention pioneer) status in the Americana music world. And though the Houston native has never worn his Texas heart on his sleeve, he&#39;s long been regarded as one of the Lone Star State&#39;s finest (not to mention top-drawing) true singer-songwriters. He was still a relative unknown in 1989 when his third studio album, West Textures, was released - especially on the triple bill he shared at the time touring with legends Townes Van Zandt and Guy Clark - but once fellow Texas icon Joe Ely recorded both &quot;The Road Goes on Forever&quot; and &quot;Whenever Kindness Fails&quot; on his 1993 album, Love and Danger, the secret was out on Keen&#39;s credentials as a songwriter&#39;s songwriter. By the end of the decade, Keen was a veritable household name in Texas, headlining a millennial New Year&#39;s Eve celebration in Austin that drew an estimated 200,000 people. A dozen years later, he was inducted into the Texas Heritage Songwriters Hall of Fame along with the late, great Van Zandt and his longtime friend from Texas A & M, Lyle Lovett.The middle child of a geologist father and an attorney mother, Keen was weaned on classic rock (in particular, the psychedelic blues trio Cream) and his older brother&#39;s Willie Nelson records - but it was his younger sister&#39;s downtown Houston celebrity status as a &quot;world-champion foosball player&quot; that exposed him to the area&#39;s acoustic folk scene. By the time he started working on his English degree at Texas A&M, he was teaching himself guitar and setting his poetic musings to song. That in turn led to a college fling with a bluegrass ensemble (featuring his childhood friend Bryan Duckworth, who would continue to play fiddle with Keen well into the &#39;90s) and front-porch picking parties with fellow Aggie Lovett at Keen&#39;s rental house - salad days captured in spirit on the Keen/Lovett co-write, &quot;The Front Porch Song,&quot; which both artists would eventually record on their respective debut albums.While Lovett&#39;s self-titled debut was released on major-label Curb Records, Keen took the road less travelled, self-financing and producing 1984&#39;s No Kinda Dancer and leasing it to the independent label Rounder Records, which issued it on its Philo imprint. &quot;It was difficult, because I didn&#39;t know what I was doing ... I literally opened up the phonebook and looked for studios,&quot; Keen recalls. &quot;I basically put it all together through brute force and ignorance, but I was shocked with how well it worked out and very happy with it. We had a release party at Butch Hancock&#39;s Dixie Bar and Bustop, and Lyle and Nanci Griffith and a lot of those people who were a part of the Austin folkie scene came out.&quot;Keen himself had already started to make quite a name for himself on that scene, thanks to four years of constant regional gigging and winning the Kerrville Folk Festival&#39;s prestigious New Folk songwriting competition in 1983. After his debut&#39;s release, he began touring more and more outside of the state lines, eventually moving to Nashville in 1986. Keen&#39;s stint in Music City, U.S.A., lasted just under two years, but he returned to Texas armed with a publishing deal, a new label (another indie, Sugar Hill), and a national booking agent. He closed the decade with 1988&#39;s The Live Album and the following year&#39;s West Textures, the album that marked the debut of &quot;The Road Goes on Forever&quot; and, not inconsequently, kicked his career into high gear.With hindsight, Keen admits he no idea at the time of writing it that his song about a couple of ill-fated lovers running afoul of the law would have the legs it did, but he readily points to the forward thinking of DJ Steve Coffman of San Antonio radio station KRIO for helping to start the fire. &quot;He talked the station into doing sort of a free-form programing format, basically anything he liked, which turned out to be some Texas music along with a lot of cool sort of pop music,&quot; he says. &quot;So all of a sudden, I heard my song back-to-back with the Sheryl Crow song that was popular at the time, and that was the first time that I really felt like I was a real part of the music business, despite having been in it already for a pretty long time. And right after that, I went to a show in San Antonio and there were 1,500 people there - whereas up to that point I&#39;d been playing to, max, maybe 150. That was the real ah-hah moment for me that really got me going and kept me going, because before that I&#39;d been doing this for eight or 10 years and had a lot of rejection but very little success.&quot;After that, though, success came in spades. Although he continued to steer clear of the Garth Brooks-dominated waters of the country mainstream, the perfect storm of Keen&#39;s literate song craft, razor wit and killer band (more on that in a bit) stirred up a grassroots sensation in Texas not seen since the &#39;70s heyday of maverick &quot;outlaw country&quot; upstarts Willie, Waylon, and Jerry Jeff Walker. Armed with two more albums (1993&#39;s A Bigger Piece of Sky and &#39;94&#39;s Gringo Honeymoon) brimming with instant classics like &quot;Corpus Christi Bay,&quot; &quot;Whenever Kindness Fails,&quot; &quot;Gringo Honeymoon,&quot; &quot;Dreadful Selfish Crime&quot; and &quot;Merry Christmas From the Family,&quot; he began packing dancehalls, roadhouses, theaters, and festival grounds with diverse crowds of rowdy college kids, serious singer-songwriter fans and plenty of folks who, like Keen himself, had been around the Texas music scene long enough to remember Willie&#39;s earliest 4th of July Picnics. And the phenomenon was not confined to the Texas state lines. Famed producer and pedal steel ace Lloyd Maines (Joe Ely, Terry Allen) helped Keen and his band bottle lighting on 1996&#39;s No. 2 Live Dinner, a next-best-thing-to-being-there concert document that remains one of Keen&#39;s best-selling albums, and the burgeoning Americana music scene (bolstered by AAA radio stations across the country and magazines like No Depression) embraced Keen as one of its prime movers. In the wake of albums like 1997&#39;s Picnic and &#39;98&#39;s Walking Distance (both released on major-label Arista), one would have been hard-pressed to tell the difference between a rabid Robert Earl Keen crowd at Texas&#39; legendary Gruene Hall and those at New York City joints like Tramps and the Bowery Ballroom. Little wonder, then, that when the songwriter-revering &quot;Americana&quot; style was officially recognized by the industry 1998, Keen was the genre&#39;s first artist to be featured on the cover of the radio trade magazine Gavin.The &#39;90s may have been a boom period for Keen, but his momentum hasn&#39;t ebbed a bit since the turn of the century - nor has his pursuit of continued growth as a writer and artist. If anything, his output from the last decade has been marked by some of the most adventurous music of his career. &quot;Wild Wind,&quot; an unforgettable highlight from Gravitational Forces, his Gurf Morlix-produced 2001 debut for the Nashville-based Americana label Lost Highway, captured the character (and characters) of a small Texas town with a cinematic eye reminiscent of The Last Picture Show; but the album&#39;s title track also found Keen wryly experimenting with spacey, beatnik jazz. For the freewheelin&#39;, freak-flag-flying Farm Fresh Onions (2003, Audium/Koch), Keen and producer Rich Brotherton (his longtime guitarist) took the band into the proverbial garage to knock out their most rocking set of songs to date - most notably the psychedelic rave-up of the title track. Brotherton also produced the more rootsy but equally playful What I Really Mean (2005, E1 Music), but Lloyd Maines was back at the helm for 2009&#39;s eclectic The Rose Hotel and 2011&#39;s spirited Ready for Confetti (both released by Lost Highway). The later was especially well received by fans and critics alike, with AllMusic&#39;s Thom Jurek raving, &quot;Ready for Confetti is, without question, Keen&#39;s most inspired and focused project in nearly 20 years.&quot; His latest project released in 2015, &quot;Happy Prisoner: The Bluegrass Sessions&quot; was a straight -ahead &quot;love postcard to bluegrass&quot;. This was something Keen had wanted to do for a long time and it was now or never. Keen is ranked Billboard&#39;s No. 2, 2015 Bluegrass Artist of the year. His current recording, Happy Prisoner: The Bluegrass Sessions, charted as 2015&#39;s Top 5 album at Americana Radio and Billboard&#39;s 2015 No. 2 album on the Bluegrass Albums chart.Earlier this year, Keen played three weeks of sold-out theater dates with Lyle Lovett, just two longtime college friends swapping songs on acoustic guitars like they used to do on Keen&#39;s front porch in College Station. But the lion&#39;s share of his concert schedule still finds him playing full-tilt with his seasoned road and studio band: Brotherton on guitar, Bill Whitbeck on bass, Tom Van Schaik on drums, and Marty Muse on steel guitar. &quot;I&#39;ve been with this band for 20 years now,&quot; Keen says proudly. &quot;I used to think that was just sort of an interesting fact, but now it&#39;s almost a total anomaly - that just doesn&#39;t happen much. I always felt like once you lock into the right bunch of people, you try to do the best by them that you can. So we&#39;ve been able to stay together a long time, and I think one thing that makes it worthwhile for people to come see us as an act is the fact that it&#39;s not like we&#39;re trying to work it all out onstage - we&#39;ve already worked everything out.&quot;REK has had the honor of working with music legends Dave Matthews, Bonnie Raitt, Sheryl Crow, Eric Church, Gary Clark, Jr. among others. He was inducted into the Texas Heritage Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2012. In March 2015, Robert Earl Keen was recognized as the first recipient of BMI&#39;s official Troubadour Award. Keen is an active member of NARAS and was invited to be a participant in the prestigious &quot;Grammys On The Hill&quot; where he sang the National Anthem at the opening ceremony and was a member of the delegation that lobbied US Congress to support musicians&#39; rights, specifically the &quot;Fair Pay for Fair Play Act&quot;.But the road goes on and on, with no time for resting on laurels. Not that Keen&#39;s complaining. &quot;I had a relatively open schedule for 2016 back at the beginning of the year, but it has just filled in like you wouldn&#39;t believe,&quot; he marvels during a rare day off in Kerrville, Texas (where he lives with his wife and two daughters). &quot;I&#39;ve broke my record this year - I&#39;ve packed for five trips at one time, because I wasn&#39;t going to be starting any of them in the same place. It&#39;s been crazy!It isn&#39;t always easy being Robert Earl Keen, but somebody&#39;s got to do it. And now more than ever, he&#39;s up to the task and loving every minute of it.",

		"description": " <br> &quot;When was the last time you attended a live music performance with a genuine element of risk involved? And no, going to a Gwar show with a white t-shirt on doesn&#39;t count. When Bit Brigade takes the stage your mind will frantically oscillate between &quot;Oh! Agh!! Please don&#39;t die!!&quot; and &quot;YES! He&#39;s doing it!!&quot; Combining the dread and daring of a live video game speed run with the spot-on technique of a live band covering the musical accompaniment to everything you&#39;re seeing on-screen in real time, Bit Brigade will have you swinging between the two mediums. From thrashing about to live renditions of your favorite stage themes, fingers yearning to the sky in a rock &#39;n roll parody of sea anemones seeming to silently plead, &quot;Please, feed us more fretboard pyrotechnics!,&quot; to being locked in stock-still rapture as the infallible maestro of the d-pad, Noah McCarthy, takes on the final boss and risks his video game life under the threat of intense peer scorn (or the reward of night-long glory and a credits score). No matter the outcome, Bit Brigade must play on until the deed is done - which it always is - on the first (and last) try. Once Noahs NES buzzes on, there&#39;s no turning back.&quot; - Metalhead Mike of The Shizz, summer 2011",

		"description": " <br> Electronic Pop / Dream Pop from Milwaukee WIby Lizzy Goodman, Winter 2016The day after GGOOLLDD frontwoman Margaret Butler graduated from art school in Baton Rouge she packed a Uhaul and headed west. I was like, yeah, Im not going to live here anymore, she recalls, laughing. Her first stop was Portland, Oregon, where she subsisted mostly on ramen noodles and pumpkins people stole for me from Home Depot, she remembers. You saut them down and add lots of black pepper and curry powder and soy sauce. Its actually pretty good! Butler was riding high on that particular sense of freedom that comes when youve decided your life plan is to just say yes to pretty much everything. So you dont really care that youre broke and subsisting on stolen jack-o-lanterns, because youre not in your suburban high school anymore, hiding your disdain for the cheerleaders. Youre in a weird and cool new town, hanging out with musicians and designers and artists. Youre free to mess around. Explore. And just when youre starting to get a little over living four people deep, as Butler puts it, in your tiny apartment, another friend says, hey, come out to Wisconsin for a while. So you do. (Because: say yes!) And a while later, when, boozy in a bar one night, you hear some beats you think youd like to write lyrics to, even though youve never so much as held a microphone in your life, you go for it. (Say. Yes.) And the next thing you know, youre fronting a dynamic, dirty, synth-pop carnival of a band, hearing your single on the radio, and touring the country. Thats Margaret Butlers story. And thats the story of her band, a group as inspired by the shimmery decadence of Queen as they are by the primal yowl of Black Sabbath as they are by the madcap joy of Yeah Yeah Yeahs. GGOOLLDD is one of the most resolutely celebratory rock acts to emerge in years.Its not hard to understand how someone like Butler, a woman with seemingly limitless natural charisma and an obsession with dressing up in outrageous costumes (Halloween is her favorite holiday) would eventually find her way onstage, but the singer insists that rock stardom was never part of her plan. I never even considered being a musician, I always wanted to be a clothing designer, or a chef, she says. Ive always created with my hands. Butlers father is jeweler, and technically thats what she was studying to be as well. But she learned all her really important college-years lessons bartending at the Spanish Moon, a legendary venue in Baton Rouge. It was the only cool place to go and watch music in the city, she says. I got to see every amazing band as they were coming up, from TV On the Radio to Of Montreal to Dirty Projectors. Even though Butlers always loved music (shes an obsessive of the first order) aside from the one time she got really stoned and watched a John Bonham documentary then went right out and bought a pair of blue 1970s Ludwigs, she never tried to become a serious musician. I have great internal rhythm, Im just too A.D.D. to sit down and actually play, she says. I own eight different instruments and Ive gotten as far as like a week on each of them. But her culture, her people, her tribe has always been connected to music. The people she met in and around the Spanish Moon were the ones she moved to Portland with, and it was through that world that she wound up, one random early fall afternoon in 2013, recording vocals, in the foyer of her house in Milwaukee, to what would become GGOOLLDDs breakthrough debut single. It was the first song we ever wrote and it was called Gold, she recalls of the soulfully grimy track, on which bassist Nick Ziemann, guitarist Thomas Gilbert also played. (They added drummer Mark Stewart and synth player Nick Schubert soon after). We were like, Oh we need a name for the band - I guess it should be the same thing as the song title. A quick Google search revealed eight other bands named Gold, but they were all basically unsearchable because the word is so widely used, so we just decided to double letter it. Thinking nothing of it, they threw the song up on Bandcamp, planning to go back to their day jobs, but thats when the serendipity hurricane began. Somehow college radio picks it up, Butler recalls. And it starts getting really good responses. And then its on their list of top-ten-plays list, which is just insane. So they figured, why not keep this going for a while? We were like, this is fun! Lets write like three more songs, do a cover, and throw a party for Halloween where we can all wear gold costumes! The Halloween party is now the stuff of GGOOLLDD legend. I was Santigold, but instead of dressing up like the singer, I made an all gold Santa costume, Butler recalls, laughing. We played a terrible show to eight-some people crammed into our attic and it was one of the funnest nights ever! After that, people just kept asking us to play.Butler, who had by this time opened a vintage clothing business with her friends, initially thought of the band mostly as a good excuse to express her most playful sartorial impulses. We had our next show two weeks later so I made this weird tassled vinyl gold overlay on top of a crushed velvet gold romper, she remembers, but it wasnt long before they all realized this band had become more than an excuse to dress up. After that second show, CMJ picked up Gold, from the local Milwaukee radio station, 91.7, and from there, other college radio stations around the country began playing the track as well. The same un-mixed, un-mastered version they had made on Garage Band. After about a year I was like, people like this a lot better and they want to pay me a lot more than they do for vintage clothing, so I think Im just going to do this instead, Butler recalls. Its been three years and we have ten songs that are out right now, and were working on the next album. GGOOLLDD isnt like other bands. They formed on whim, decided to play their first show mostly as an excuse to host a killer party, and they eschew the traditional gotta-get-a-record-deal game in favor of playing a lot of shows and releasing their own material. That sense of whimsy blended with resolute autonomy is all part of the signature GGOOLLDD aesthetic. And it feeds into their sound, especially lately. Secrets, their new single, is a soaring banger that conjures wind-in-your-hair glittery romanticism. Co-produced and mixed by Ben H. Allen (MIA, Animal Collective) it reflects that core tension in GGOOLLDD between winging it and great artistry. Im not going to lie, Im great at writing a hook, Butler says, and is quick to point out that her bandmates are amazing, musicians. But if you ask me what I do, Im going to tell you that Im a performer before I tell you that Im a musician. She pauses and cracks up. Unless you dont know me at all, she continues. Then Im going to say Im a musician, because if I say Im a performer, youre going to automatically think that Im a stripper, which is totally ok too but not my current profession.",

		"description": " with Park Doing<br> Twenty-four years ago in 1994, 38-year-old school teacher Robert Pollard & his merry band recorded Bee Thousand in a Dayton, Ohio basement on a 4-track cassette recorder. This improbable rock classic became an enormously influential album; Spin and Pitchfork have called it one of the best records of the 90s, and Amazon picked Bee Thousand as #1 on their list of the 100 Greatest Indie Rock Albums Of All Time. An amazing live band with a rabid following, the Washington Post called GBV the Grateful Dead equivalent for people who like Miller Lite instead of acid!GBVs new line-up re-unites Robert Pollard with former bandmembers Doug Gillard and Kevin March, along with exciting newcomers Mark Shue and Bobby Bare Jr. The group has been wowing audiences from coast to coast.",

		"description": " with Cory Branan<br> Amanda Shires is not an entertainer. She isnt looking to help listeners escape their everyday lives or soundtrack celebrations. She isnt reaching for celebrity, and she isnt concerned with cultivating a personal brand. She is an artist in the true sense of the word, meaning she creates because she has a real need for the process of creating. That is not to say that the songs on My Piece Of Landarent entertaining, but that quality is a by-product. The real intention here is to relate. Ms. Shires began her career as a teenager playing fiddle with the Texas Playboys. Since then, shes toured and recorded with John Prine, Billy Joe Shaver, Todd Snider, Justin Townes Earle, Shovels & Rope, and most recently her husband Jason Isbell. Along the way shes made three solo albums, each serving to document a particular period in her life while improving on the perceptive qualities of the previous record. The songs on My Piece Of Land deal with family, with anxiety, with the phases of one young womans life; but the primary focus of My Piece Of Landis the concept of home. Ms. Shires addresses the similarities and differences between the home she was born into, the two homes she was eventually split between, and the home she has finally made for herself. Some of these stories are from the creators point of view and some most certainly are not. Youd be hard-pressed to identify which is which, though, considering the level of empathy involved in the creation of these stories. The concept of home, like the concept of love, is more complex than it seems, says Ms. Shires. You start out with this inherited idea of home, but as you grow you realize thats only a suggestion. You have to use that along with all the little pieces of wisdom youve picked up along the way to finally build your own place in the world. Ms. Shires sometimes describes songwriting as solving the puzzles, but before the songwriter even begins to arrange rhymes and melodies, she must first be acquainted with the complicated workings of the heart. Most of this album was written after Ms. Shires had reached the seven-month point in a summertime pregnancy, and was no longer able to travel. For a woman used to touring most of the year, being stuck inside brought challenges and offered creative rewards. Pregnancy does weird things to you, Amanda says. You walk around holding your arms over your belly, sometimes almost overcome by anxiety. I constantly wondered if I would be able to protect this child, if my marriage would last forever, if Id learned enough about the world to be a good mother. At the same time, youre so excited, so hopeful, and so severely physically limited. About how the setting affected the finished product, she says This record turned out to be a personal record, set in our home where I had lots of time for reflection and time to face my concerns and fears. The listener can hear Ms. Shires unpacking those anxieties in a song like Slippin, with its ruminations on what could go wrong in a relationship that seems stable. Therell be a trigger,then up starts the fire,a handful of matchessome faulty wiring.Youll say you have this hollow feeling. Somethings always been missing. Tonight could be the night you go slippin&#39; away from me. Her piece of land is one with a panoramic view, and she pays close attention to even the smallest details. Take, for instance, the first stanza of Harmless. A phased golden light rained down from the streetlight. It fell across your shoulder, paused just above your collar. With this description of one fleeting moment, the writer sets an entire scene. Ms. Shireswould argue that the term poet should not be used to mean unusually perceptive songwriter, since the roles of modern songwriter and poet are so very different. However, it isnt hard to understand how her post-graduate education in poetry helps Ms. Shires choose which details to include. Its all about precision. My time in the MFA (Master Of Fine Arts) program at Sewanee taught me a lot about different ways of writing and how they all have one thing in common: the better you are at editing, the better your work will be. Spending long hours workshopping poems and reading the classics gave me a solid standard when it came time to edit my songs. Ms. Shires recorded My Piece Of Land under the guidance of brilliant Nashville producer Dave Cobb at his Low Country Sound studio. Inviting Cobb to produceMy Piece Of Landwas an easy decision to make, considering Ms. Shires had worked with him before on Jason Isbell&#39;s albums Southeastern and Something More Than Free. Ms. Shires knew of Daves propensity toward arranging the songs in-studio, rather than rehearsing or making demos beforehand. Cobb believes in the spontaneity of early takes, and with the proficient rhythm section of Paul Slivka and Paul Griffith, the studio band was able to record the album in a relatively short amount of time without sacrificing performance quality. This approach gives each song on the album emotional urgency along with a groove thats loose and effortless. Among other things, Pale Fire is about consciously shifting ones own priorities. There are two types of lovers: the kind we need and the kind we want. The hard part is finding someone who represents both. You Are My Home is written as a gift, a token of appreciation to someone who has helped the narrator define her place in the world. Mineral Wells is a song Ms. Shires wrote many years ago, after relocating to Nashville from her childhood home in Texas. It speaks to the part of us that never really leaves that original homeplace. With My Piece Of Land, you get the sense that Amanda Shires has reached a personal pinnacle. This album is the creative milestone suited to accompany the recent milestones in her life: becoming a mother, developing into a true artist, and finally finding a home.",

		"description": " <br> After 18-plus years of performing more than 100 concerts annually, releasing nine studio albums and selling more than 4.2 million tracks online, Umphreys McGee might be forgiven if they chose to rest on their laurels. But then that wouldnt be consistent with the work ethic demonstrated by the band, which consistently attempts to raise the bar, setting and achieving new goals since forming on the Notre Dame campus in South Bend, Indiana, in 1997. After releasing their eighth studio album, Similar Skin, the first for their own indie label, Nothing Too Fancy (N2F) Music (distributed by RED), the group continued to push the envelope and test the limits. The London Session, was a dream come true for the members having been recorded at the legendary Studio Two at historic Abbey Road. The stealth recording session yielded 10 tracks in a single day, proving once again, the prolific UM waits for no one.As a follow up to The London Session, the envelope pushing continues with the November 11th release of ZONKEY. Umphreys McGee has been arranging and performing original mashups live for over eight years. It was only a matter of when, not if, some of those innovative concoctions would find their way into a studio. An album of 12 unique mashups, conceived and arranged by the band, ZONKEY is as seamless as it bizarre, playful as it is razor sharp. Bits and pieces of classic songs are culled from 40-plus years of popular music from 70s Reggae to 80s Pop to 90s Metal and everywhere in between. From Radiohead mashed with Beck, The Weeknd with Fleetwood Mac, Talking Heads with Bob Marley, Metallica with Gorillaz . . . nothing is off limits.The original Umphreys McGee played a mix of originals and cover songs, waiting just eight months to release their debut album, the cheekily titled Greatest Hits Volume III. Their initial proper recording, Local Band Does OK, came out in 2002, followed shortly afterward by an appearance at the first-ever Bonnaroo in Tennessee, selling more albums than any other band on the bill. The 2007 double album, Live at the Murat, earned a four-star review in Rolling Stone and a Jammy for Best Live Album.Despite attempts at categorizing UM, the band has devoted its craft to making their devoted followers feel as if they are part of something larger, through such technology-fueled innovations as fan-curated sets, the immersive high-end audio offering, Headphones & Snowcones, where the pristine sound of the live soundboard mix is piped wirelessly through high-end personal monitor systems and headphones, as well as making every live show since 2005 available via their live music portal UMLive.net. UM were also the first group to launch its own single-artist streaming service.Finding themselves in London for three shows at the Brooklyn Bowl in June 2014, the idea of recording at Abbey Road was first proposed by Umphreys producer Manny Sanchez, a notion, as Bayliss told Rolling Stone that seemed as likely as being asked to give a sermon at the Vatican.It wasnt a goal, he explains, because it never seemed like a possibility. But never to be bound by what seems possible, UM secured a coveted day at the worlds most famous recording studio and dove in headfirst.Twelve hours after first setting foot in Abbey Road Studios, just before midnight, Umphreys McGee left the historic room with their own new album, The London Session, what Rolling Stone dubs a historical primer, an evolution story inside 51 minutes.This November 11th, prepare to get Zonkeyd. An album unlike any previous Umphreys McGee effort, this unique take on the mash-up concept is yet another example that there arent many places Umphreys McGee wont take you.Umphreys McGee are more than just a rock band through nearly two decades, they have proven to be on the cutting-edge of both music and technology, super-serving their fans through a community that stretches from the campus of Notre Dame to the hallowed halls of Abbey Road.",

		"description": " <br> Five years have passed since Case&#39;s last solo project, The Worse Things Get, the Harder I Fight, the Harder I Fight, the More I Love You. In the interim, she sang on Whiteout Conditions, the 2017 release from longtime bandmates the New Pornographers. The year before that, she released a vinyl box set of her solo work and joined k.d. Lang and Laura Veirs on the case/lang/veirs project.Recording that record was a revelation, from Veirs&#39; innovative guitar tunings to Lang&#39;s skills in studio. &quot;I learned so much experiencing the work ethic of those two,&quot; Case says. She considers Lang &quot;probably the most natural producer I&#39;ve ever seen. Watching her work was awe-inspiring.&quot;After their national tour together, Case found similar transcendence in October 2016 sitting on a panel at the first-of-its-kind &quot;Woman Producer&quot; summit in Brooklyn, NY. Between discussions and performances from a diverse group of women who produce music from around the world, she wondered how it had taken such a long time to get to that moment, and why so many female pioneers had been forgotten.She felt lucky to have worked with the people she had encountered across her career-Darryl Neudorf, Tucker Martine, Craig Schumacher, and Chris Schultz among them-who encouraged her to expand her own skills in studio. But she had also gotten fed up with a world in which women&#39;s accomplishments seemed to vanish from public memory. &quot;The George Martins and Quincy Joneses of the recording pantheon deserve every drop of praise and every project they have received,&quot; Case says. &quot;But we can&#39;t keep telling the same stories over and over. We need more stories, more inspiration, more flavors.&quot;She set to work on her next record looking for not just new stories but also new sounds. This time, she wanted to put herself in a setting far away from everything she knew. She recalled Bjrn Yttling&#39;s skill with Lykke Li, Camera Obscura, and his own band, Peter Bjorn and John. &quot;I&#39;ve worked with the same people so long, I never had to step outside my comfort zone,&quot; Case says. &quot;In this instance, I chose to.&quot;The two met over breakfast in Washington, DC, and decided to team up. By the time she went to Sweden in the fall of 2017, Case had already written songs with longtime collaborator Paul Rigby, laid down vocal and guitar tracks at WaveLab Studio in Tucson, and built Carnacial Singing, her recording space in Vermont.But in the middle of her stint in Stockholm, with the finish line in sight, she received a surreal 3am call telling her that her house was burning and would likely be completely destroyed. She felt panicked and helpless.The fire had started in the barn, where she kept an assortment of belongings, from artwork to old pianos. A friend had managed to get the dogs to safety. After the flames jumped to the house, her home was engulfed, too.A few hours later, she went into a studio in Stockholm and laid down the vocals for &quot;Bad Luck,&quot; singing the lines she had written long before she realized they would land on her.Case is now stoic about the fire. &quot;If somebody burned your house down on purpose, you&#39;d feel so violated. But when nature burns your house down, you can&#39;t take it personally.&quot; The month before the blaze, Hurricane Harvey had slammed into Texas and flooded Houston. Her home burned just as Puerto Rico was plunged into a nightmare by Hurricane Maria and wildfires incinerated California. &quot;In the big picture, my house burning was so unimportant,&quot; she says. &quot;So many people lost so much more: lives and lives and lives.&quot;She was hell-bent on not losing sight of the goal, reminding herself there was still beauty in the world and in the process of making music. She had been reading a lot of ancient history, including Adrienne Mayor&#39;s The Amazons, and thinking about how for millennia, women have been more central to events than the average history class admits. &quot;We were always there, we were just erased. And I knew it. As a little girl I knew it. As a young person I knew it,&quot; Case says. &quot;Now I know it anew with a ferocious, righteous, razor-sharp tribe of witnesses, and it makes me feel like a super-powerful human being. It makes me feel joy. There&#39;s an inheritance there that&#39;s really important, and I want to share it.&quot;She decided to climb inside her role as producer and wield it more directly. It just meant owning what she was already doing.***The record that came out of this reckoning with lost stories delivers both familiar Neko Case and something different. Death, extinction, exploitation, tides, animals, and adoration all blend recognizably. Case&#39;s trademark narrative gaps, just large enough for listeners to enter each song, likewise remain. As with Fox Confessor Brings the Flood and Middle Cyclone, Hell-On spins away from conventions of story, slipping into real life, with its fierce mess and blind catastrophes.&quot;I&#39;m writing fairy tales, and I hear my life story in them, but they&#39;re not about me,&quot; Case says. &quot;I still can&#39;t figure out how to describe it. But I think that&#39;s why we make music or write things. You&#39;ve got to invent a new language.&quot;There are differences, too. The opening kalimba notes of the first track, &quot;Hell On,&quot; lead into a waltz of deep forces, irresistible as gravity, that refuse to be leashed or controlled (&quot;You&#39;ll not be my master / you&#39;re barely my guest&quot;). This tornado might not love you.Case planned this record with a commitment to big choruses and a goal of making them even bigger. The results appear in the anthemic &quot;Last Lion of Albion,&quot; a requiem for every landscape and iconic creature (&quot;last tiger of Tasmania / the last she-wolf to suckle Rome&quot;) erased through massacre and marketing. Rounding out the opening trilogy of false possession is &quot;Halls of Sarah,&quot; a song for unwilling muses tormented by poets who love women &quot;as lions love Christians.&quot;&quot;Bad Luck,&quot; recorded from the ground up in Stockholm, opens at a gallop and never breaks stride. A song always poses the challenge of when to move away from the groove and how to get back to it. But Yttling pointed out to Case that sometimes the whole song should be the hook-that there&#39;s no shame in exploiting the catchiest part. That became the strategy for bringing &quot;Bad Luck&quot; to life. Longtime collaborators Kelly Hogan and Nora O&#39;Connor came up with backing vocals that build a giddy, knowing call and response into the song.For &quot;The Curse of the I-5 Corridor,&quot; former Screaming Trees frontman Mark Lanegan duets with Case on a ballad of memory and departure. Melancholy grooves &quot;Gumball Blue&quot; and &quot;My Uncle&#39;s Navy&quot; mark Case&#39;s first songwriting efforts with New Pornographers cofounder Carl Newman. And after performing it live for years, Case has finally done a studio recording with Eric Bachmann of his song &quot;Sleep All Summer,&quot; which moved her to pull over to the side of the road and cry the first time she heard it on the radio.The labyrinthine &quot;Dirty Diamond&quot; opens onto room after room of shifting vocals that soar above a march-like rhythm. &quot;Oracle of the Maritimes,&quot; perhaps the most fairy tale song on the record, floats over a tuning invented by co-writer Laura Veirs, carrying a love that longs to prove itself (&quot;come on sweet girl let&#39;s find you an ocean / that goes with your eyes&quot;).Clouds of mosquitoes rising out of hot tires, a chest of drawers that rides out into the waves, a box filled with unnamed newborn creatures: these songs are bursting with images that can only be understood through peripheral vision, shards of imaginary lives wired into a mosaic.Later comes &quot;Winnie,&quot; a pirate love song for a woman with a mouth &quot;as sharp as the rib of a star.&quot; The song came from the afterglow of reading Amazons. &quot;There aren&#39;t enough songs that are obviously about a woman loving another woman, just loving her, Sapphic or Platonic,&quot; Case says. &quot;I thought there should be one, because I know I sit around loving them all day.&quot;The record ends with &quot;Pitch or Honey,&quot; winding its way through intimate verses sung over a drum machine before blooming into layered vocals, a bigger beat, and a wall of sound. &quot;Am I making pitch or honey?&quot; fades into repetition of &quot;I love you better when you&#39;re wild.&quot;The record was born at the hands of some three dozen performers in all, from k.d. Lang, Laura Veirs, Beth Ditto, and Robert Forster on backing vocals, to Joey Burns of Calexico and Doug Gillard of Guided by Voices on guitars, and Barbara Gruska and Matt Chamberlain on drums. The sidelong perspective is part of the known Neko galaxy, but the production is more expansive and edgier, moving into new universes. These are songs that can swallow you.***When Case returned to the US and walked through the ruins of her home, the fire that had blazed after these songs were written became part of the record. For the cover, she made a warrior&#39;s helmet out of cigarettes. Interior and exterior shots of her incinerated house appear on the gatefold and booklet. And a tiny pop-open charred Brothers-Grimm cottage serves as the set for the video of &quot;Bad Luck.&quot;It was as if nature invented a landscape for Hell-On after the fact: a melted ladder, seared insulation dangling in ribbons, the internal organs of pianos. She thought it should all be included in solidarity with those who had lost so much in the past year.All the living creatures present at the time of the fire were found alive, and so Case was able see beauty in the bleak scene. &quot;It felt like this out-of-time Jacques Cousteau undersea expedition through a sunken World War II ship. Of course there&#39;s some shit I miss,&quot; she says, citing family photographs and a favorite sweater. &quot;But none of it matters.&quot;And as for those fairy tales she&#39;s writing and the history she&#39;s remembering: &quot;We need them now more than ever. We need stories from all sectors. Stories without endings. Stories with multiple endings. Stories that don&#39;t end happily, cautionary tales, everything. We don&#39;t need Disneyfied stories anymore.&quot;A force of nature, an act of a mercurial, forgotten god, Hell-On is a record sealed by fire, filled with love and rage and dangers that might lay waste to everything at any moment. So if you wake up dazed in a smoking landscape, walking through the detritus of your own lost civilization with the smell of ash in your hair, your favorite sweater gone and a new song in your head, don&#39;t say you weren&#39;t warned.",

		"description": " with King Tuff, Presented by Birmingham Mountain Radio<br> Father John Misty is the brainchild of singer-songwriter Josh Tillman. Tillman has released three widely acclaimed albums Fear Fun (2012), I Love You, Honeybear (2015) and his most recent release, Pure Comedy, his Grammy-nominated album (2017). Father John Misty has also recently contributed to songs by Beyonc and Lady Gaga. As for his most recent album, Pure Comedyit is a complex, often-sardonic, and, equally often, touching meditation on the confounding folly of modern humanity. The album has earned Father John Misty placement on over &quot;50 Best of 2017&quot; lists from Entertainment Weekly, The Guardian, The Sunday Times, Rolling Stone, Stereogum, Pitchfork and more. The reception to Pure Comedy also led to a series of incredible performances with Saturday Night Live,Austin City Limits, the Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Tonight Showand Late Night with Seth Meyers. He recently completed a wildly successful tour in support of the Pure Comedy, and will release its follow up in 2018.",

		"description": " with Snacks<br> Iceage is Elias Bender Rnnenfelt, Dan Kjr Nielsen, Johan Suurballe Wieth, and Jakob Tvilling Pless. Beyondless, Iceages fourth record (and first that was recorded all-analog), was produced by the band and Nis Bysted, recorded by Mattias Glav at Kungsten Studios Gteberg, and mixed by Randall Dunn at Avast Studios Seattle. The album was played entirely by the band with additional performances by Nils Grndhal (violin), horns by Kasper Tranberg (trumpet), Lars Greve (saxophones) and Morten Jessen (trombone), and vocals on Pain Killer by Sky Ferreira.Below please find further words on this moving, majestic new album and its nuanced craftsmanship from Daniel Stewart (Total Control) and Richard Hell.-The beauty of a moral act depends on the beauty of its expression. To say that it is beautiful is to decide that it will be so. It remains to be proved so. This is the task of images, that is, of the correspondences with the physical world. The act is beautiful if it provokes, and in our throat reveals, song. Sometimes the consciousness with which we have pondered a reputedly vile act, the power of expression which must signify it, impels us to song. This means that treachery is beautiful if it makes us sing.-Genet, A Thiefs JournalBeyondless is the 4th LP from Iceage. This record radiates joy.Pay attention to the journey, from New Brigade, a juvenile delinquent take on post-punk, full of cold, distant condemnation, and onto the ecstasy of Youre Nothing, shedding the more aggressive hardcore influence and dragging in more light, a tendency followed on Plowing Into The Field Of Love. The intoxication is consistent, this has always been drunk music, but its less a stumbling confusion and more a sturdy heartfelt confession with each record. They have finally caught up with their ambition. Their entire charm has always rested in their running ahead of themselves with blind confidence, taunting you to follow and you follow because wherever they are going is vital, is alive; on Beyondless they are treading with an assurance that is disarming, but there is no loss of charm, you are arm in arm now, whispering intimacies.Intimacies that recall other intimacies: something must have happened when Iceage heard Gun Club Miami. Some traumatic event! A wild band has not been tamed, but is in repose, retaining an edge but expressing something less definite, something about hurt or longing or regret.Attention must be directed toward the brilliance of EBRs lyricism on Beyondless! In his evocations of beauty in profane imagery, in his plumbing of the depths of betrayal and criminality, there are suggestions of Jean Genet and the disgraceful slurring of Leonard Cohen.Loves Forever Changes is an appropriate reference point for the record, orchestral touches to rock music that reached in a very affected / effected manner toward some transcendent experience. You can hear blissful catatonic evocations of the Waterboys, slurring face down on the bar some holy affirmations. Overall, the strongest suggestion is of the Stones in their Exile period, holed up in some decadent mansion attempting to pay tribute to American music from country honk brawls to sleazy soul revues to cocaine blues, it has this confident air of music written in the midst of excessive reveries.Letting in the light, the joy radiates. They are post post-punk, Beyondless retains the rich character of their brash beginnings, but this is something beyond, oh hell, this is something very, very special, a generous gift for an anemic age.-Daniel Stewart (Total Control)-THE NEW ICEAGEby Richard HellI can totally imagine myself as a kid lying in my closed-door room in the dark, listening to this band and getting what I need, the way a band can make a person feel seen and bring confidence, sometimes even represent an ideal. Or maybe Im already all defiant and self-certain, and I identify with Iceage because they are too, and theyre who I want to represent me in music. Its a weird combination of qualities that a rock and roll band and their recordings presents to their young crowd, imparts to them. The music being pure emotion, the strong emotions of youthanger, sadness, contempt, longingas well as energy and sex, and the bands demonstration that it gracefully owns and provides those things, consoling their followers in all the confusion.What is it that Iceage in particular brings? A large number of extraordinary things. (Poetry! But more about that later.) The band members were childhood friends, which is always good news. Theyre like a small urban gang, faithful to each other, suspicious of outsiders (of which music journalists like me are the most suspect examples). At the same time, they seem mature and competent, which is almost too much to hope for. They not only play and compose well, but the production of their records, from the very beginning, and at the musics most chaotic, is impeccable. Their presentation is as hardcore anarchic as any, but much better played, mixed, and recorded than most.And then theres the poetry and the intelligence. The members of Iceage are not only smart but hyper literate. Interviews with E. Rnnenfelt, the lead singer and lyricist of the band, find him mentioning Carson McCullers, The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter; Georges Bataille, Story of the Eye; Peter Shaffers Equus; Mishima, The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea; Genets Thiefs Journal and Miracle of the Rose; The Torture Garden by Octave Mirbeau; Henry Miller on Writing; and James Agees A Death in the Family, and thats in a total of four interviews. Its not that he flaunts it; hes simply honest and naturally acknowledges it.The lyrics of Iceage songs have the most sophisticated vocabulary I can remember finding in rock music. Heres a favorite example, from Pain Killer (ft Sky Ferreira) on the new album:Praying at the altar of your legs and feetYour saliva is a drug so bittersweetIll arrogate whats there to takeIn an evanescent embraceArrogate??? I half know the word, but I had to look it up to be certain. It means to claim or seize without justification. Its funny because its Latin root also underlies the word arrogant, which one might be tempted to apply to Rnnenfelt for the contempt he shows for people who try to understand him. But I sympathize. It is extremely annoying to be characterized by other people. And the shading of meaning of the word arrogate brings a subtlety to those lyrics of his that take or seize or claim wouldnt. Frankly, though, what I really like about those lines is the concept of praying to his lovers feet. Thats good. It makes me think of a similar instance in another poet, Charles Baudelaire, who wrote in his Hymn to Beauty:Who cares if you come from paradise or hell,appalling Beauty, artless and monstrous scourge,if only your eyes, your smile or your foot revealthe infinite I love and have never known?",

		"description": " with KinZie<br> Is it possible to be nostalgic for the future? Brooklyn synthpop duo Great Good Fine Ok met one evening in 2013 and by the next morning had written their first song together, &quot;You&#39;re the One for Me,&quot; a gauzy, heart-thumping anthem that hit #1 on Hype Machine twice in one month and instantly established the group&#39;s sound with Jon Sandler&#39;s dancefloor falsetto soaring over Luke Moellman&#39;s lush post-Space Age production, the perfect soundtrack for retrofuturism. An EP, Body Diamond, soon followed, as did a slate of shows at that year&#39;s SXSW festival and a deal with Neon Gold and Epic Records. In 2014 GGFO&#39;s second EP, 2M2H, reached #10 on the iTunes dance chart and featured the St. Lucia collaboration &quot;Something to Believe In,&quot; which premiered on Entertainment Weekly. In keeping with this collaborative spirit, GGFO co-wrote and performed on The Chainsmoker&#39;s single &quot;Let You Go,&quot; recorded a cover of Phil Collins&#39;s &quot;Easy Lover&quot; with fellow Brooklynite Panama Wedding, and produced the song &quot;Shapeshifting&quot; with Irish folk-pop singer Orla Gartland, whom Jon and Luke met after their headlining show at Notting Hill Arts Club in London. They have also remixed songs by St Lucia, Foxes, Twenty One Pilots, Luxley, Little Daylight, and many others.In the past three years, GGFO have performed shows supporting acts ranging from Tove Lo to X Ambassadors to Penguin Prison and have embarked on four major US tours with Betty Who, Joywave, Magic Man, Vacationer, and Panama Wedding, with four songs reaching #1 on Hype Machine and their single &quot;Take It or Leave It&quot; surpassing ten million plays on Spotify. As anyone who attended the group&#39;s recent sold-out Northeast headlining tour can attest, GGFO has amassed a large contingent of loyal fans who have come to expect over-the-top live performances involving silk kimonos, triggered lights, and histrionic keytar solos, with Jon and Luke backed by drummer Danny Wolf and guitarist Carey Clayton. 2016 has already seen the release of three singles and an EP of GGFO songs remixed by like-minded artists, with more new works ever looming on the horizon. Music blog Indie Shuffle says, &quot;I dare you to find another group in the past two years who has been so prolific and consistent with their releases while at the same time delivering some of the most heavenly signature falsetto vocals known to man.&quot;",

		"description": " <br> Like a flood, middle school make out, or amateur adult film, it all began in the basement. The now-famed Yacht Rock Revue was once a band called Y-O-U, pursuing dreams of indie rock fame, when they were given free reign over Thursday nights at 10 High. In the Virginia- Highlands subterranean music lair, they did everything from original tunes to theme sets like Led Zeppelin vs. The Who to comedy (which bombed). But it was the impulse idea to smoothly croon 70s light rock (Hall & Oates, Michael McDonald, Linda Ronstadt, etc.) whilst wearing polyester, aviators, and captains hats that captured the peoples hearts. In early 2008, Yacht Rock became a weekly occurrence; by 2009 the citys cool kids were packing out 10 High on Thursdays nights and tossing back PBRs in their own captains hats, and by 2010, the eight guys (only one of whom has since left the band to join Blackberry Smoke) quit their day jobs and began stockpiling polyester suits.D id the indie rockers dream of being a cover band? About as much as a Rich Girl wants to get a job at Shoneys. But they were tapping into an underserved genre of music, captivating folks both young and old, and their legions of cultish fans are glad they stayed swayed with it. When they finally moved the tunes up to sea level, it was for a holiday show at the Variety Playhouse in 2009. Theyd never heard of a local band renting out the place for a concert, so decided to give it a whirl...and it sold out. Yacht Rock was legit.Larger gigs poured in (corporate events, weddings, Park Tavern) and the band wondered if they could get the very artists they covered to join them on stage while they were out on tour. Spoiler alert: They could (everyone has a price). It started with Walter Egan at a show in Nashville, and they have since shared the stage with Eddie Money, John Oates, and Bobby Kimball from Toto, to name just a few. Theyve played at the Playboy Mansion (obviously), sang the national anthem at the Atlanta Braves game on Fourth of July (complete with Greg and Nick jumping off stage and rounding the bases), opened for Ludacris and Macklemore and Ryan Lewis during the Final Four, sailed on music cruises with Kid Rock, Train, Heart, Weezer, and Kiss (for the record, they do NOT drive the boat), and have packed out shows in NYC, Nashville, Los Angeles, and more. The guys (who actually like each other in real life) have developed a flawless, signature style with spot-on renditions, refreshing comedy, and energetic stage presence any band would covet. Theyve received accolades like Best Place to Get Drunk With Your Dad to Best Overall Music Act in Atlanta to Best Place to Start an Extramarital Affair, and have been name-dropped by the New York Times, Pitchfork, the Guardian UK, Spin, TimeOut New York, Billboard, MTV.com, and (probably) your mom at her last Tupperware party.And its not always pure AM Gold glory, as they perform under many aliases: Please PleaseRock Me (Beatles), Reagan Rock (Smooth 80s) Uno Dos Tres Catorce (U2), Dazed and Confused (&#39;70s Stoner Rock), Rock Fight (Led Zeppelin vs. the Who, Tom Petty vs. Fleetwood Mac, etc.) and so forth. Yacht Rock Revue also performs many classic albums in their entirety, including Michael Jackson&#39;s Thriller, Pink Floyd&#39;s Dark Side of the Moon, Prince&#39;s Purple Rain, the Beatles&#39; Sgt. Pepper&#39;s Lonely Hearts Club Band, XTC&#39;s Black Sea, and Led Zeppelin IV. But no matter what theyre playing, its always a license to let loose. Smooth rock on, yall.",

		"description": " with Terra Lightfoot<br> Rock n roll has rarely been as smart, soulful or satisfying than it has in the hands of The Posies. During an on/off career thats stretched across four decades, the Seattle-rooted outfit, led by musical polymaths Jon Auer and Ken Stringfellow, have shaped and re-shaped their muse, creating one of the more compelling catalogues in modern pop.With SOLID STATES, their 8th album, the Posies mark dramatic changes in the lives, the music, the evolution of the band.When the Posies long time drummer, Darius, died suddenly and unexpectedly last year, Posies founding members Jon Auer and Ken Stringfellow were devastated. Hard as it was to continue without such a close friend and great musician, the moment called for a reinvention. For now the idea of the band getting into a room and banging out the music, garage band style, was over. The ideas coming from Jon and Ken were fragile and the moods contemplative. Death, divorce, loss. Even the joys of life are fleeting enough as to be treated with care and respect.Of course, the Posies still retain their legendary melodic abilities, their trademark vocal harmonies and their lyrical agility. The band has always been exploring, growing. The multiyear gaps between albums are typically spent in countless other projects that bring new skills, sounds, experiences and people to the picture. The band will present the album live in a new format, incorporating laptop elements along with guitars, keyboards and drums. As artists, the band feels its their duty to take risks and explore.",

She contributed to the #1 album The Hamilton Mixtape; her track, &quot;Congratulations, has notched over 5 million streams. As a writer, shes been published by The New York Times Magazine, broadcast by Minnesota Public Radio, published two literary collections of her own, and is set to release her first hardcover collection with Dutton Books in the fall of 2018. She&#39;s been covered by Pitchfork, Forbes, and The Wall Street Journal amongst others. The LA Times says Dessa sounds like no one else. The Utne Reader calls her a one-woman powerhouse. On the stage and on the page, her style is defined by a ferocity, wit, tenderness, and candor. Dessas third full-length album Chime (Doomtree Records), listed by NPR as one of 2018s most anticipated records, is out now. http://smarturl.it/dessachime",

Emma Ruth Rundle will be performing solo June 8th through 14th, Alexis Marshall (of the band Daughters) will be reading from his book as well as other poems June 9th through June 14th, and Null from Birmingham Alabama (members of Coliseum) will be performing June 15th through 21st. Looking forward.Young Widows&#39; bruising 2006 debut, Settle Down City, introduced the Louisville, KY trio as an ugly force to be reckoned with. Two years later they dropped Old Wounds, their sophomore stomp that inspired at least a dozen imitators of varying degrees of success. From there the band traded some of their trademark fury for the bleak, widescreen atmospheres of In and Out of Youth and Lightness. Now, three years later, Young Widows meld the strengths of their past and their tenacity for the future to forge Easy Pain, an album perfectly befitting their merciless moniker.",

		"description": " <br> Barring the invention of time travel, Electric Avenue is, hands down, the most accurate and exciting 80s Pop Tribute youre going to find anywhere this side of 1988. A high-definition snapshot of an era when vintage synthesizers and drum machines were at the top of the food chain, a thing called Radio. Having been invited to share stages from Los Angeles to Tampa, Bahamas to Jamaica, by the likes of Pat Benatar, Kid Rock, Bobby Kimball (Toto), Jimmy Kimmel and Adam Carolla, and at sea on the Walking Dead Cast Cruise, Kid Rocks lucky 7th Annual Chillin The Most Cruise, The Pitbull Cruise and the Gronk Cruise with Rob Gronkowski (New England Patriots). They were also bestowed the honor of being the final band to ever perform at Turner Field. A private show for the Atlanta Braves and their Game Day Staff is not something this band takes lightly, let alone being allowed to run the bases! Awesome.Electric Avenue delivers spot-on renditions of Tears for Fears, Wham!, Duran Duran, Simple Minds, Howard Jones, Frankie Goes To Hollywood, Level 42, Naked Eyes, Soft Cell, Kenny Loggins, INXS, Prince, The Clash, OMD, David Bowie and more. Enough songs and memories to ensure that you are the star of your own John Hughes film! With these 20 year touring veterans all in one band, its no wonder that youve seen them on stages or in studios beside members of Toto, Loverboy, Jellyfish, Emmy Lou Harris, Idina Menzel, Alanis Morissette, Daniel Lanois, Brian Blade, Noel Gallaghers High Flying Birds, Little River Band, Daughtry, Player, Neil Finn, Don Henley, Sarah McLachlan, Sheryl Crow, RENT (The Musical), Kristian Bush, Sugarland, Train, Robbie Dupree, Brantley Gilbert, Michael Buble, John Mayer, Zac Brown Band, Nickelback, B-52s, Boston, Collective Soul, Billy Currington, Mother&#39;s Finest, Sister Hazel, Lionel Richie, Paul Simon, Yanni, Robert Randolph and the Family Band, Janes Addiction, Yellowcard, Boyz II Men & India Arie.Unless you have a DeLorean with a fully charged Flux Capacitor, youre not going to find a more authentic 80s Pop Tribute in the known universe.",

		"description": " <br> &quot;The road goes on forever ...&quot;It&#39;s not always easy to sum up a career - let alone a life&#39;s ambition - so succinctly, but those five words from Robert Earl Keen&#39;s calling-card anthem just about do it. You can complete the lyric with the next five words - the ones routinely shouted back at Keen by thousands of fans a night (&quot;and the party never ends!&quot;) - just to punctuate the point with a flourish, but it&#39;s the part about the journey that gets right to the heart of what makes Keen tick. Some people take up a life of playing music with the goal of someday reaching a destination of fame and fortune; but from the get-go, Keen just wanted to write and sing his own songs, and to keep writing and singing them for as long as possible.&quot;I always thought that I wanted to play music, and I always knew that you had to get some recognition in order to continue to play music,&quot; Keen says. &quot;But I never thought of it in terms of getting to be a big star. I thought of it in terms of having a really, really good career and writing some good songs, and getting onstage and having a really good time.&quot;Now three-decades on from the release of his debut album - with eighteen other records to his name, thousands of shows under his belt and still no end in sight to the road ahead - Keen remains as committed to and inspired by his muse as ever. And as for accruing recognition, well, he&#39;s done alright on that front, too; from his humble beginnings on the Texas folk scene, he&#39;s blazed a peer, critic, and fan-lauded trail that&#39;s earned him living-legend (not to mention pioneer) status in the Americana music world. And though the Houston native has never worn his Texas heart on his sleeve, he&#39;s long been regarded as one of the Lone Star State&#39;s finest (not to mention top-drawing) true singer-songwriters. He was still a relative unknown in 1989 when his third studio album, West Textures, was released - especially on the triple bill he shared at the time touring with legends Townes Van Zandt and Guy Clark - but once fellow Texas icon Joe Ely recorded both &quot;The Road Goes on Forever&quot; and &quot;Whenever Kindness Fails&quot; on his 1993 album, Love and Danger, the secret was out on Keen&#39;s credentials as a songwriter&#39;s songwriter. By the end of the decade, Keen was a veritable household name in Texas, headlining a millennial New Year&#39;s Eve celebration in Austin that drew an estimated 200,000 people. A dozen years later, he was inducted into the Texas Heritage Songwriters Hall of Fame along with the late, great Van Zandt and his longtime friend from Texas A & M, Lyle Lovett.The middle child of a geologist father and an attorney mother, Keen was weaned on classic rock (in particular, the psychedelic blues trio Cream) and his older brother&#39;s Willie Nelson records - but it was his younger sister&#39;s downtown Houston celebrity status as a &quot;world-champion foosball player&quot; that exposed him to the area&#39;s acoustic folk scene. By the time he started working on his English degree at Texas A&M, he was teaching himself guitar and setting his poetic musings to song. That in turn led to a college fling with a bluegrass ensemble (featuring his childhood friend Bryan Duckworth, who would continue to play fiddle with Keen well into the &#39;90s) and front-porch picking parties with fellow Aggie Lovett at Keen&#39;s rental house - salad days captured in spirit on the Keen/Lovett co-write, &quot;The Front Porch Song,&quot; which both artists would eventually record on their respective debut albums.While Lovett&#39;s self-titled debut was released on major-label Curb Records, Keen took the road less travelled, self-financing and producing 1984&#39;s No Kinda Dancer and leasing it to the independent label Rounder Records, which issued it on its Philo imprint. &quot;It was difficult, because I didn&#39;t know what I was doing ... I literally opened up the phonebook and looked for studios,&quot; Keen recalls. &quot;I basically put it all together through brute force and ignorance, but I was shocked with how well it worked out and very happy with it. We had a release party at Butch Hancock&#39;s Dixie Bar and Bustop, and Lyle and Nanci Griffith and a lot of those people who were a part of the Austin folkie scene came out.&quot;Keen himself had already started to make quite a name for himself on that scene, thanks to four years of constant regional gigging and winning the Kerrville Folk Festival&#39;s prestigious New Folk songwriting competition in 1983. After his debut&#39;s release, he began touring more and more outside of the state lines, eventually moving to Nashville in 1986. Keen&#39;s stint in Music City, U.S.A., lasted just under two years, but he returned to Texas armed with a publishing deal, a new label (another indie, Sugar Hill), and a national booking agent. He closed the decade with 1988&#39;s The Live Album and the following year&#39;s West Textures, the album that marked the debut of &quot;The Road Goes on Forever&quot; and, not inconsequently, kicked his career into high gear.With hindsight, Keen admits he no idea at the time of writing it that his song about a couple of ill-fated lovers running afoul of the law would have the legs it did, but he readily points to the forward thinking of DJ Steve Coffman of San Antonio radio station KRIO for helping to start the fire. &quot;He talked the station into doing sort of a free-form programing format, basically anything he liked, which turned out to be some Texas music along with a lot of cool sort of pop music,&quot; he says. &quot;So all of a sudden, I heard my song back-to-back with the Sheryl Crow song that was popular at the time, and that was the first time that I really felt like I was a real part of the music business, despite having been in it already for a pretty long time. And right after that, I went to a show in San Antonio and there were 1,500 people there - whereas up to that point I&#39;d been playing to, max, maybe 150. That was the real ah-hah moment for me that really got me going and kept me going, because before that I&#39;d been doing this for eight or 10 years and had a lot of rejection but very little success.&quot;After that, though, success came in spades. Although he continued to steer clear of the Garth Brooks-dominated waters of the country mainstream, the perfect storm of Keen&#39;s literate song craft, razor wit and killer band (more on that in a bit) stirred up a grassroots sensation in Texas not seen since the &#39;70s heyday of maverick &quot;outlaw country&quot; upstarts Willie, Waylon, and Jerry Jeff Walker. Armed with two more albums (1993&#39;s A Bigger Piece of Sky and &#39;94&#39;s Gringo Honeymoon) brimming with instant classics like &quot;Corpus Christi Bay,&quot; &quot;Whenever Kindness Fails,&quot; &quot;Gringo Honeymoon,&quot; &quot;Dreadful Selfish Crime&quot; and &quot;Merry Christmas From the Family,&quot; he began packing dancehalls, roadhouses, theaters, and festival grounds with diverse crowds of rowdy college kids, serious singer-songwriter fans and plenty of folks who, like Keen himself, had been around the Texas music scene long enough to remember Willie&#39;s earliest 4th of July Picnics. And the phenomenon was not confined to the Texas state lines. Famed producer and pedal steel ace Lloyd Maines (Joe Ely, Terry Allen) helped Keen and his band bottle lighting on 1996&#39;s No. 2 Live Dinner, a next-best-thing-to-being-there concert document that remains one of Keen&#39;s best-selling albums, and the burgeoning Americana music scene (bolstered by AAA radio stations across the country and magazines like No Depression) embraced Keen as one of its prime movers. In the wake of albums like 1997&#39;s Picnic and &#39;98&#39;s Walking Distance (both released on major-label Arista), one would have been hard-pressed to tell the difference between a rabid Robert Earl Keen crowd at Texas&#39; legendary Gruene Hall and those at New York City joints like Tramps and the Bowery Ballroom. Little wonder, then, that when the songwriter-revering &quot;Americana&quot; style was officially recognized by the industry 1998, Keen was the genre&#39;s first artist to be featured on the cover of the radio trade magazine Gavin.The &#39;90s may have been a boom period for Keen, but his momentum hasn&#39;t ebbed a bit since the turn of the century - nor has his pursuit of continued growth as a writer and artist. If anything, his output from the last decade has been marked by some of the most adventurous music of his career. &quot;Wild Wind,&quot; an unforgettable highlight from Gravitational Forces, his Gurf Morlix-produced 2001 debut for the Nashville-based Americana label Lost Highway, captured the character (and characters) of a small Texas town with a cinematic eye reminiscent of The Last Picture Show; but the album&#39;s title track also found Keen wryly experimenting with spacey, beatnik jazz. For the freewheelin&#39;, freak-flag-flying Farm Fresh Onions (2003, Audium/Koch), Keen and producer Rich Brotherton (his longtime guitarist) took the band into the proverbial garage to knock out their most rocking set of songs to date - most notably the psychedelic rave-up of the title track. Brotherton also produced the more rootsy but equally playful What I Really Mean (2005, E1 Music), but Lloyd Maines was back at the helm for 2009&#39;s eclectic The Rose Hotel and 2011&#39;s spirited Ready for Confetti (both released by Lost Highway). The later was especially well received by fans and critics alike, with AllMusic&#39;s Thom Jurek raving, &quot;Ready for Confetti is, without question, Keen&#39;s most inspired and focused project in nearly 20 years.&quot; His latest project released in 2015, &quot;Happy Prisoner: The Bluegrass Sessions&quot; was a straight -ahead &quot;love postcard to bluegrass&quot;. This was something Keen had wanted to do for a long time and it was now or never. Keen is ranked Billboard&#39;s No. 2, 2015 Bluegrass Artist of the year. His current recording, Happy Prisoner: The Bluegrass Sessions, charted as 2015&#39;s Top 5 album at Americana Radio and Billboard&#39;s 2015 No. 2 album on the Bluegrass Albums chart.Earlier this year, Keen played three weeks of sold-out theater dates with Lyle Lovett, just two longtime college friends swapping songs on acoustic guitars like they used to do on Keen&#39;s front porch in College Station. But the lion&#39;s share of his concert schedule still finds him playing full-tilt with his seasoned road and studio band: Brotherton on guitar, Bill Whitbeck on bass, Tom Van Schaik on drums, and Marty Muse on steel guitar. &quot;I&#39;ve been with this band for 20 years now,&quot; Keen says proudly. &quot;I used to think that was just sort of an interesting fact, but now it&#39;s almost a total anomaly - that just doesn&#39;t happen much. I always felt like once you lock into the right bunch of people, you try to do the best by them that you can. So we&#39;ve been able to stay together a long time, and I think one thing that makes it worthwhile for people to come see us as an act is the fact that it&#39;s not like we&#39;re trying to work it all out onstage - we&#39;ve already worked everything out.&quot;REK has had the honor of working with music legends Dave Matthews, Bonnie Raitt, Sheryl Crow, Eric Church, Gary Clark, Jr. among others. He was inducted into the Texas Heritage Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2012. In March 2015, Robert Earl Keen was recognized as the first recipient of BMI&#39;s official Troubadour Award. Keen is an active member of NARAS and was invited to be a participant in the prestigious &quot;Grammys On The Hill&quot; where he sang the National Anthem at the opening ceremony and was a member of the delegation that lobbied US Congress to support musicians&#39; rights, specifically the &quot;Fair Pay for Fair Play Act&quot;.But the road goes on and on, with no time for resting on laurels. Not that Keen&#39;s complaining. &quot;I had a relatively open schedule for 2016 back at the beginning of the year, but it has just filled in like you wouldn&#39;t believe,&quot; he marvels during a rare day off in Kerrville, Texas (where he lives with his wife and two daughters). &quot;I&#39;ve broke my record this year - I&#39;ve packed for five trips at one time, because I wasn&#39;t going to be starting any of them in the same place. It&#39;s been crazy!It isn&#39;t always easy being Robert Earl Keen, but somebody&#39;s got to do it. And now more than ever, he&#39;s up to the task and loving every minute of it.",

		"description": " <br> Scrubs is a 90s Dance Party began in 2003 in Washington, DC as a one-off concept party by friends and DJ partners Will Eastman and Brian Billion. The idea was simple: play both guilty pleasures and underground classics you listened to growing up in the 90s: Salt-N-Pepa and Nirvana. Ace of Base and Happy Mondays. The Prodigy and Biggie. By its third edition, the party began to sell out the Black Cat back stage and, later, the Cats mainstage. In 2009, the party moved to the spacious 9:30 Club, whose sound and light systems are simply incredible, and quickly filled it with a legion of happy revelers, too. It is now the largest and longest running 90s party in America. Rather than host No Scrubs weekly or monthly, Eastman and Billion insist on keeping the party occasional and as guilty a pleasure as they want it to be. Exercise your pleasure groove to 2Pac, Biggie, Ace of Base, Backstreet Boys, Beastie Boys, Bell Biv Devoe, Britney, C&C Music Factory, Color Me Bass, Cypress Hill, Green Day, Nirvana, Jay-Z, Keith Sweet, Kris Kross, LL Cool J, Naughty By Nature, *NSYNC, Oasis, Salt-N-Pepa, Sir Mix-A-Lot, Smashing Pumpkins, Snoop Dogg, Spice Girls, SWV, TLC, A Tribe Called Quest, Weezer, Wu-Tang and everyone 90s all night long. Be sure to get there at doors for this special event which only comes around a couple times per year and always sells out. Look forward to seeing you on the dance floor!!! Special guest: Ozker",

		"description": " <br> Electronic Pop / Dream Pop from Milwaukee WIby Lizzy Goodman, Winter 2016The day after GGOOLLDD frontwoman Margaret Butler graduated from art school in Baton Rouge she packed a Uhaul and headed west. I was like, yeah, Im not going to live here anymore, she recalls, laughing. Her first stop was Portland, Oregon, where she subsisted mostly on ramen noodles and pumpkins people stole for me from Home Depot, she remembers. You saut them down and add lots of black pepper and curry powder and soy sauce. Its actually pretty good! Butler was riding high on that particular sense of freedom that comes when youve decided your life plan is to just say yes to pretty much everything. So you dont really care that youre broke and subsisting on stolen jack-o-lanterns, because youre not in your suburban high school anymore, hiding your disdain for the cheerleaders. Youre in a weird and cool new town, hanging out with musicians and designers and artists. Youre free to mess around. Explore. And just when youre starting to get a little over living four people deep, as Butler puts it, in your tiny apartment, another friend says, hey, come out to Wisconsin for a while. So you do. (Because: say yes!) And a while later, when, boozy in a bar one night, you hear some beats you think youd like to write lyrics to, even though youve never so much as held a microphone in your life, you go for it. (Say. Yes.) And the next thing you know, youre fronting a dynamic, dirty, synth-pop carnival of a band, hearing your single on the radio, and touring the country. Thats Margaret Butlers story. And thats the story of her band, a group as inspired by the shimmery decadence of Queen as they are by the primal yowl of Black Sabbath as they are by the madcap joy of Yeah Yeah Yeahs. GGOOLLDD is one of the most resolutely celebratory rock acts to emerge in years.Its not hard to understand how someone like Butler, a woman with seemingly limitless natural charisma and an obsession with dressing up in outrageous costumes (Halloween is her favorite holiday) would eventually find her way onstage, but the singer insists that rock stardom was never part of her plan. I never even considered being a musician, I always wanted to be a clothing designer, or a chef, she says. Ive always created with my hands. Butlers father is jeweler, and technically thats what she was studying to be as well. But she learned all her really important college-years lessons bartending at the Spanish Moon, a legendary venue in Baton Rouge. It was the only cool place to go and watch music in the city, she says. I got to see every amazing band as they were coming up, from TV On the Radio to Of Montreal to Dirty Projectors. Even though Butlers always loved music (shes an obsessive of the first order) aside from the one time she got really stoned and watched a John Bonham documentary then went right out and bought a pair of blue 1970s Ludwigs, she never tried to become a serious musician. I have great internal rhythm, Im just too A.D.D. to sit down and actually play, she says. I own eight different instruments and Ive gotten as far as like a week on each of them. But her culture, her people, her tribe has always been connected to music. The people she met in and around the Spanish Moon were the ones she moved to Portland with, and it was through that world that she wound up, one random early fall afternoon in 2013, recording vocals, in the foyer of her house in Milwaukee, to what would become GGOOLLDDs breakthrough debut single. It was the first song we ever wrote and it was called Gold, she recalls of the soulfully grimy track, on which bassist Nick Ziemann, guitarist Thomas Gilbert also played. (They added drummer Mark Stewart and synth player Nick Schubert soon after). We were like, Oh we need a name for the band - I guess it should be the same thing as the song title. A quick Google search revealed eight other bands named Gold, but they were all basically unsearchable because the word is so widely used, so we just decided to double letter it. Thinking nothing of it, they threw the song up on Bandcamp, planning to go back to their day jobs, but thats when the serendipity hurricane began. Somehow college radio picks it up, Butler recalls. And it starts getting really good responses. And then its on their list of top-ten-plays list, which is just insane. So they figured, why not keep this going for a while? We were like, this is fun! Lets write like three more songs, do a cover, and throw a party for Halloween where we can all wear gold costumes! The Halloween party is now the stuff of GGOOLLDD legend. I was Santigold, but instead of dressing up like the singer, I made an all gold Santa costume, Butler recalls, laughing. We played a terrible show to eight-some people crammed into our attic and it was one of the funnest nights ever! After that, people just kept asking us to play.Butler, who had by this time opened a vintage clothing business with her friends, initially thought of the band mostly as a good excuse to express her most playful sartorial impulses. We had our next show two weeks later so I made this weird tassled vinyl gold overlay on top of a crushed velvet gold romper, she remembers, but it wasnt long before they all realized this band had become more than an excuse to dress up. After that second show, CMJ picked up Gold, from the local Milwaukee radio station, 91.7, and from there, other college radio stations around the country began playing the track as well. The same un-mixed, un-mastered version they had made on Garage Band. After about a year I was like, people like this a lot better and they want to pay me a lot more than they do for vintage clothing, so I think Im just going to do this instead, Butler recalls. Its been three years and we have ten songs that are out right now, and were working on the next album. GGOOLLDD isnt like other bands. They formed on whim, decided to play their first show mostly as an excuse to host a killer party, and they eschew the traditional gotta-get-a-record-deal game in favor of playing a lot of shows and releasing their own material. That sense of whimsy blended with resolute autonomy is all part of the signature GGOOLLDD aesthetic. And it feeds into their sound, especially lately. Secrets, their new single, is a soaring banger that conjures wind-in-your-hair glittery romanticism. Co-produced and mixed by Ben H. Allen (MIA, Animal Collective) it reflects that core tension in GGOOLLDD between winging it and great artistry. Im not going to lie, Im great at writing a hook, Butler says, and is quick to point out that her bandmates are amazing, musicians. But if you ask me what I do, Im going to tell you that Im a performer before I tell you that Im a musician. She pauses and cracks up. Unless you dont know me at all, she continues. Then Im going to say Im a musician, because if I say Im a performer, youre going to automatically think that Im a stripper, which is totally ok too but not my current profession.",

		"description": " with Cory Branan<br> Amanda Shires is not an entertainer. She isnt looking to help listeners escape their everyday lives or soundtrack celebrations. She isnt reaching for celebrity, and she isnt concerned with cultivating a personal brand. She is an artist in the true sense of the word, meaning she creates because she has a real need for the process of creating. That is not to say that the songs on My Piece Of Landarent entertaining, but that quality is a by-product. The real intention here is to relate. Ms. Shires began her career as a teenager playing fiddle with the Texas Playboys. Since then, shes toured and recorded with John Prine, Billy Joe Shaver, Todd Snider, Justin Townes Earle, Shovels & Rope, and most recently her husband Jason Isbell. Along the way shes made three solo albums, each serving to document a particular period in her life while improving on the perceptive qualities of the previous record. The songs on My Piece Of Land deal with family, with anxiety, with the phases of one young womans life; but the primary focus of My Piece Of Landis the concept of home. Ms. Shires addresses the similarities and differences between the home she was born into, the two homes she was eventually split between, and the home she has finally made for herself. Some of these stories are from the creators point of view and some most certainly are not. Youd be hard-pressed to identify which is which, though, considering the level of empathy involved in the creation of these stories. The concept of home, like the concept of love, is more complex than it seems, says Ms. Shires. You start out with this inherited idea of home, but as you grow you realize thats only a suggestion. You have to use that along with all the little pieces of wisdom youve picked up along the way to finally build your own place in the world. Ms. Shires sometimes describes songwriting as solving the puzzles, but before the songwriter even begins to arrange rhymes and melodies, she must first be acquainted with the complicated workings of the heart. Most of this album was written after Ms. Shires had reached the seven-month point in a summertime pregnancy, and was no longer able to travel. For a woman used to touring most of the year, being stuck inside brought challenges and offered creative rewards. Pregnancy does weird things to you, Amanda says. You walk around holding your arms over your belly, sometimes almost overcome by anxiety. I constantly wondered if I would be able to protect this child, if my marriage would last forever, if Id learned enough about the world to be a good mother. At the same time, youre so excited, so hopeful, and so severely physically limited. About how the setting affected the finished product, she says This record turned out to be a personal record, set in our home where I had lots of time for reflection and time to face my concerns and fears. The listener can hear Ms. Shires unpacking those anxieties in a song like Slippin, with its ruminations on what could go wrong in a relationship that seems stable. Therell be a trigger,then up starts the fire,a handful of matchessome faulty wiring.Youll say you have this hollow feeling. Somethings always been missing. Tonight could be the night you go slippin&#39; away from me. Her piece of land is one with a panoramic view, and she pays close attention to even the smallest details. Take, for instance, the first stanza of Harmless. A phased golden light rained down from the streetlight. It fell across your shoulder, paused just above your collar. With this description of one fleeting moment, the writer sets an entire scene. Ms. Shireswould argue that the term poet should not be used to mean unusually perceptive songwriter, since the roles of modern songwriter and poet are so very different. However, it isnt hard to understand how her post-graduate education in poetry helps Ms. Shires choose which details to include. Its all about precision. My time in the MFA (Master Of Fine Arts) program at Sewanee taught me a lot about different ways of writing and how they all have one thing in common: the better you are at editing, the better your work will be. Spending long hours workshopping poems and reading the classics gave me a solid standard when it came time to edit my songs. Ms. Shires recorded My Piece Of Land under the guidance of brilliant Nashville producer Dave Cobb at his Low Country Sound studio. Inviting Cobb to produceMy Piece Of Landwas an easy decision to make, considering Ms. Shires had worked with him before on Jason Isbell&#39;s albums Southeastern and Something More Than Free. Ms. Shires knew of Daves propensity toward arranging the songs in-studio, rather than rehearsing or making demos beforehand. Cobb believes in the spontaneity of early takes, and with the proficient rhythm section of Paul Slivka and Paul Griffith, the studio band was able to record the album in a relatively short amount of time without sacrificing performance quality. This approach gives each song on the album emotional urgency along with a groove thats loose and effortless. Among other things, Pale Fire is about consciously shifting ones own priorities. There are two types of lovers: the kind we need and the kind we want. The hard part is finding someone who represents both. You Are My Home is written as a gift, a token of appreciation to someone who has helped the narrator define her place in the world. Mineral Wells is a song Ms. Shires wrote many years ago, after relocating to Nashville from her childhood home in Texas. It speaks to the part of us that never really leaves that original homeplace. With My Piece Of Land, you get the sense that Amanda Shires has reached a personal pinnacle. This album is the creative milestone suited to accompany the recent milestones in her life: becoming a mother, developing into a true artist, and finally finding a home.",

		"description": " <br> After 18-plus years of performing more than 100 concerts annually, releasing nine studio albums and selling more than 4.2 million tracks online, Umphreys McGee might be forgiven if they chose to rest on their laurels. But then that wouldnt be consistent with the work ethic demonstrated by the band, which consistently attempts to raise the bar, setting and achieving new goals since forming on the Notre Dame campus in South Bend, Indiana, in 1997. After releasing their eighth studio album, Similar Skin, the first for their own indie label, Nothing Too Fancy (N2F) Music (distributed by RED), the group continued to push the envelope and test the limits. The London Session, was a dream come true for the members having been recorded at the legendary Studio Two at historic Abbey Road. The stealth recording session yielded 10 tracks in a single day, proving once again, the prolific UM waits for no one.As a follow up to The London Session, the envelope pushing continues with the November 11th release of ZONKEY. Umphreys McGee has been arranging and performing original mashups live for over eight years. It was only a matter of when, not if, some of those innovative concoctions would find their way into a studio. An album of 12 unique mashups, conceived and arranged by the band, ZONKEY is as seamless as it bizarre, playful as it is razor sharp. Bits and pieces of classic songs are culled from 40-plus years of popular music from 70s Reggae to 80s Pop to 90s Metal and everywhere in between. From Radiohead mashed with Beck, The Weeknd with Fleetwood Mac, Talking Heads with Bob Marley, Metallica with Gorillaz . . . nothing is off limits.The original Umphreys McGee played a mix of originals and cover songs, waiting just eight months to release their debut album, the cheekily titled Greatest Hits Volume III. Their initial proper recording, Local Band Does OK, came out in 2002, followed shortly afterward by an appearance at the first-ever Bonnaroo in Tennessee, selling more albums than any other band on the bill. The 2007 double album, Live at the Murat, earned a four-star review in Rolling Stone and a Jammy for Best Live Album.Despite attempts at categorizing UM, the band has devoted its craft to making their devoted followers feel as if they are part of something larger, through such technology-fueled innovations as fan-curated sets, the immersive high-end audio offering, Headphones & Snowcones, where the pristine sound of the live soundboard mix is piped wirelessly through high-end personal monitor systems and headphones, as well as making every live show since 2005 available via their live music portal UMLive.net. UM were also the first group to launch its own single-artist streaming service.Finding themselves in London for three shows at the Brooklyn Bowl in June 2014, the idea of recording at Abbey Road was first proposed by Umphreys producer Manny Sanchez, a notion, as Bayliss told Rolling Stone that seemed as likely as being asked to give a sermon at the Vatican.It wasnt a goal, he explains, because it never seemed like a possibility. But never to be bound by what seems possible, UM secured a coveted day at the worlds most famous recording studio and dove in headfirst.Twelve hours after first setting foot in Abbey Road Studios, just before midnight, Umphreys McGee left the historic room with their own new album, The London Session, what Rolling Stone dubs a historical primer, an evolution story inside 51 minutes.This November 11th, prepare to get Zonkeyd. An album unlike any previous Umphreys McGee effort, this unique take on the mash-up concept is yet another example that there arent many places Umphreys McGee wont take you.Umphreys McGee are more than just a rock band through nearly two decades, they have proven to be on the cutting-edge of both music and technology, super-serving their fans through a community that stretches from the campus of Notre Dame to the hallowed halls of Abbey Road.",

		"description": " <br> Five years have passed since Case&#39;s last solo project, The Worse Things Get, the Harder I Fight, the Harder I Fight, the More I Love You. In the interim, she sang on Whiteout Conditions, the 2017 release from longtime bandmates the New Pornographers. The year before that, she released a vinyl box set of her solo work and joined k.d. Lang and Laura Veirs on the case/lang/veirs project.Recording that record was a revelation, from Veirs&#39; innovative guitar tunings to Lang&#39;s skills in studio. &quot;I learned so much experiencing the work ethic of those two,&quot; Case says. She considers Lang &quot;probably the most natural producer I&#39;ve ever seen. Watching her work was awe-inspiring.&quot;After their national tour together, Case found similar transcendence in October 2016 sitting on a panel at the first-of-its-kind &quot;Woman Producer&quot; summit in Brooklyn, NY. Between discussions and performances from a diverse group of women who produce music from around the world, she wondered how it had taken such a long time to get to that moment, and why so many female pioneers had been forgotten.She felt lucky to have worked with the people she had encountered across her career-Darryl Neudorf, Tucker Martine, Craig Schumacher, and Chris Schultz among them-who encouraged her to expand her own skills in studio. But she had also gotten fed up with a world in which women&#39;s accomplishments seemed to vanish from public memory. &quot;The George Martins and Quincy Joneses of the recording pantheon deserve every drop of praise and every project they have received,&quot; Case says. &quot;But we can&#39;t keep telling the same stories over and over. We need more stories, more inspiration, more flavors.&quot;She set to work on her next record looking for not just new stories but also new sounds. This time, she wanted to put herself in a setting far away from everything she knew. She recalled Bjrn Yttling&#39;s skill with Lykke Li, Camera Obscura, and his own band, Peter Bjorn and John. &quot;I&#39;ve worked with the same people so long, I never had to step outside my comfort zone,&quot; Case says. &quot;In this instance, I chose to.&quot;The two met over breakfast in Washington, DC, and decided to team up. By the time she went to Sweden in the fall of 2017, Case had already written songs with longtime collaborator Paul Rigby, laid down vocal and guitar tracks at WaveLab Studio in Tucson, and built Carnacial Singing, her recording space in Vermont.But in the middle of her stint in Stockholm, with the finish line in sight, she received a surreal 3am call telling her that her house was burning and would likely be completely destroyed. She felt panicked and helpless.The fire had started in the barn, where she kept an assortment of belongings, from artwork to old pianos. A friend had managed to get the dogs to safety. After the flames jumped to the house, her home was engulfed, too.A few hours later, she went into a studio in Stockholm and laid down the vocals for &quot;Bad Luck,&quot; singing the lines she had written long before she realized they would land on her.Case is now stoic about the fire. &quot;If somebody burned your house down on purpose, you&#39;d feel so violated. But when nature burns your house down, you can&#39;t take it personally.&quot; The month before the blaze, Hurricane Harvey had slammed into Texas and flooded Houston. Her home burned just as Puerto Rico was plunged into a nightmare by Hurricane Maria and wildfires incinerated California. &quot;In the big picture, my house burning was so unimportant,&quot; she says. &quot;So many people lost so much more: lives and lives and lives.&quot;She was hell-bent on not losing sight of the goal, reminding herself there was still beauty in the world and in the process of making music. She had been reading a lot of ancient history, including Adrienne Mayor&#39;s The Amazons, and thinking about how for millennia, women have been more central to events than the average history class admits. &quot;We were always there, we were just erased. And I knew it. As a little girl I knew it. As a young person I knew it,&quot; Case says. &quot;Now I know it anew with a ferocious, righteous, razor-sharp tribe of witnesses, and it makes me feel like a super-powerful human being. It makes me feel joy. There&#39;s an inheritance there that&#39;s really important, and I want to share it.&quot;She decided to climb inside her role as producer and wield it more directly. It just meant owning what she was already doing.***The record that came out of this reckoning with lost stories delivers both familiar Neko Case and something different. Death, extinction, exploitation, tides, animals, and adoration all blend recognizably. Case&#39;s trademark narrative gaps, just large enough for listeners to enter each song, likewise remain. As with Fox Confessor Brings the Flood and Middle Cyclone, Hell-On spins away from conventions of story, slipping into real life, with its fierce mess and blind catastrophes.&quot;I&#39;m writing fairy tales, and I hear my life story in them, but they&#39;re not about me,&quot; Case says. &quot;I still can&#39;t figure out how to describe it. But I think that&#39;s why we make music or write things. You&#39;ve got to invent a new language.&quot;There are differences, too. The opening kalimba notes of the first track, &quot;Hell On,&quot; lead into a waltz of deep forces, irresistible as gravity, that refuse to be leashed or controlled (&quot;You&#39;ll not be my master / you&#39;re barely my guest&quot;). This tornado might not love you.Case planned this record with a commitment to big choruses and a goal of making them even bigger. The results appear in the anthemic &quot;Last Lion of Albion,&quot; a requiem for every landscape and iconic creature (&quot;last tiger of Tasmania / the last she-wolf to suckle Rome&quot;) erased through massacre and marketing. Rounding out the opening trilogy of false possession is &quot;Halls of Sarah,&quot; a song for unwilling muses tormented by poets who love women &quot;as lions love Christians.&quot;&quot;Bad Luck,&quot; recorded from the ground up in Stockholm, opens at a gallop and never breaks stride. A song always poses the challenge of when to move away from the groove and how to get back to it. But Yttling pointed out to Case that sometimes the whole song should be the hook-that there&#39;s no shame in exploiting the catchiest part. That became the strategy for bringing &quot;Bad Luck&quot; to life. Longtime collaborators Kelly Hogan and Nora O&#39;Connor came up with backing vocals that build a giddy, knowing call and response into the song.For &quot;The Curse of the I-5 Corridor,&quot; former Screaming Trees frontman Mark Lanegan duets with Case on a ballad of memory and departure. Melancholy grooves &quot;Gumball Blue&quot; and &quot;My Uncle&#39;s Navy&quot; mark Case&#39;s first songwriting efforts with New Pornographers cofounder Carl Newman. And after performing it live for years, Case has finally done a studio recording with Eric Bachmann of his song &quot;Sleep All Summer,&quot; which moved her to pull over to the side of the road and cry the first time she heard it on the radio.The labyrinthine &quot;Dirty Diamond&quot; opens onto room after room of shifting vocals that soar above a march-like rhythm. &quot;Oracle of the Maritimes,&quot; perhaps the most fairy tale song on the record, floats over a tuning invented by co-writer Laura Veirs, carrying a love that longs to prove itself (&quot;come on sweet girl let&#39;s find you an ocean / that goes with your eyes&quot;).Clouds of mosquitoes rising out of hot tires, a chest of drawers that rides out into the waves, a box filled with unnamed newborn creatures: these songs are bursting with images that can only be understood through peripheral vision, shards of imaginary lives wired into a mosaic.Later comes &quot;Winnie,&quot; a pirate love song for a woman with a mouth &quot;as sharp as the rib of a star.&quot; The song came from the afterglow of reading Amazons. &quot;There aren&#39;t enough songs that are obviously about a woman loving another woman, just loving her, Sapphic or Platonic,&quot; Case says. &quot;I thought there should be one, because I know I sit around loving them all day.&quot;The record ends with &quot;Pitch or Honey,&quot; winding its way through intimate verses sung over a drum machine before blooming into layered vocals, a bigger beat, and a wall of sound. &quot;Am I making pitch or honey?&quot; fades into repetition of &quot;I love you better when you&#39;re wild.&quot;The record was born at the hands of some three dozen performers in all, from k.d. Lang, Laura Veirs, Beth Ditto, and Robert Forster on backing vocals, to Joey Burns of Calexico and Doug Gillard of Guided by Voices on guitars, and Barbara Gruska and Matt Chamberlain on drums. The sidelong perspective is part of the known Neko galaxy, but the production is more expansive and edgier, moving into new universes. These are songs that can swallow you.***When Case returned to the US and walked through the ruins of her home, the fire that had blazed after these songs were written became part of the record. For the cover, she made a warrior&#39;s helmet out of cigarettes. Interior and exterior shots of her incinerated house appear on the gatefold and booklet. And a tiny pop-open charred Brothers-Grimm cottage serves as the set for the video of &quot;Bad Luck.&quot;It was as if nature invented a landscape for Hell-On after the fact: a melted ladder, seared insulation dangling in ribbons, the internal organs of pianos. She thought it should all be included in solidarity with those who had lost so much in the past year.All the living creatures present at the time of the fire were found alive, and so Case was able see beauty in the bleak scene. &quot;It felt like this out-of-time Jacques Cousteau undersea expedition through a sunken World War II ship. Of course there&#39;s some shit I miss,&quot; she says, citing family photographs and a favorite sweater. &quot;But none of it matters.&quot;And as for those fairy tales she&#39;s writing and the history she&#39;s remembering: &quot;We need them now more than ever. We need stories from all sectors. Stories without endings. Stories with multiple endings. Stories that don&#39;t end happily, cautionary tales, everything. We don&#39;t need Disneyfied stories anymore.&quot;A force of nature, an act of a mercurial, forgotten god, Hell-On is a record sealed by fire, filled with love and rage and dangers that might lay waste to everything at any moment. So if you wake up dazed in a smoking landscape, walking through the detritus of your own lost civilization with the smell of ash in your hair, your favorite sweater gone and a new song in your head, don&#39;t say you weren&#39;t warned.",

		"description": " with King Tuff, Presented by Birmingham Mountain Radio<br> Father John Misty is the brainchild of singer-songwriter Josh Tillman. Tillman has released three widely acclaimed albums Fear Fun (2012), I Love You, Honeybear (2015) and his most recent release, Pure Comedy, his Grammy-nominated album (2017). Father John Misty has also recently contributed to songs by Beyonc and Lady Gaga. As for his most recent album, Pure Comedyit is a complex, often-sardonic, and, equally often, touching meditation on the confounding folly of modern humanity. The album has earned Father John Misty placement on over &quot;50 Best of 2017&quot; lists from Entertainment Weekly, The Guardian, The Sunday Times, Rolling Stone, Stereogum, Pitchfork and more. The reception to Pure Comedy also led to a series of incredible performances with Saturday Night Live,Austin City Limits, the Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Tonight Showand Late Night with Seth Meyers. He recently completed a wildly successful tour in support of the Pure Comedy, and will release its follow up in 2018.",

		"description": " with Cory Branan<br> Amanda Shires is not an entertainer. She isnt looking to help listeners escape their everyday lives or soundtrack celebrations. She isnt reaching for celebrity, and she isnt concerned with cultivating a personal brand. She is an artist in the true sense of the word, meaning she creates because she has a real need for the process of creating. That is not to say that the songs on My Piece Of Landarent entertaining, but that quality is a by-product. The real intention here is to relate. Ms. Shires began her career as a teenager playing fiddle with the Texas Playboys. Since then, shes toured and recorded with John Prine, Billy Joe Shaver, Todd Snider, Justin Townes Earle, Shovels & Rope, and most recently her husband Jason Isbell. Along the way shes made three solo albums, each serving to document a particular period in her life while improving on the perceptive qualities of the previous record. The songs on My Piece Of Land deal with family, with anxiety, with the phases of one young womans life; but the primary focus of My Piece Of Landis the concept of home. Ms. Shires addresses the similarities and differences between the home she was born into, the two homes she was eventually split between, and the home she has finally made for herself. Some of these stories are from the creators point of view and some most certainly are not. Youd be hard-pressed to identify which is which, though, considering the level of empathy involved in the creation of these stories. The concept of home, like the concept of love, is more complex than it seems, says Ms. Shires. You start out with this inherited idea of home, but as you grow you realize thats only a suggestion. You have to use that along with all the little pieces of wisdom youve picked up along the way to finally build your own place in the world. Ms. Shires sometimes describes songwriting as solving the puzzles, but before the songwriter even begins to arrange rhymes and melodies, she must first be acquainted with the complicated workings of the heart. Most of this album was written after Ms. Shires had reached the seven-month point in a summertime pregnancy, and was no longer able to travel. For a woman used to touring most of the year, being stuck inside brought challenges and offered creative rewards. Pregnancy does weird things to you, Amanda says. You walk around holding your arms over your belly, sometimes almost overcome by anxiety. I constantly wondered if I would be able to protect this child, if my marriage would last forever, if Id learned enough about the world to be a good mother. At the same time, youre so excited, so hopeful, and so severely physically limited. About how the setting affected the finished product, she says This record turned out to be a personal record, set in our home where I had lots of time for reflection and time to face my concerns and fears. The listener can hear Ms. Shires unpacking those anxieties in a song like Slippin, with its ruminations on what could go wrong in a relationship that seems stable. Therell be a trigger,then up starts the fire,a handful of matchessome faulty wiring.Youll say you have this hollow feeling. Somethings always been missing. Tonight could be the night you go slippin&#39; away from me. Her piece of land is one with a panoramic view, and she pays close attention to even the smallest details. Take, for instance, the first stanza of Harmless. A phased golden light rained down from the streetlight. It fell across your shoulder, paused just above your collar. With this description of one fleeting moment, the writer sets an entire scene. Ms. Shireswould argue that the term poet should not be used to mean unusually perceptive songwriter, since the roles of modern songwriter and poet are so very different. However, it isnt hard to understand how her post-graduate education in poetry helps Ms. Shires choose which details to include. Its all about precision. My time in the MFA (Master Of Fine Arts) program at Sewanee taught me a lot about different ways of writing and how they all have one thing in common: the better you are at editing, the better your work will be. Spending long hours workshopping poems and reading the classics gave me a solid standard when it came time to edit my songs. Ms. Shires recorded My Piece Of Land under the guidance of brilliant Nashville producer Dave Cobb at his Low Country Sound studio. Inviting Cobb to produceMy Piece Of Landwas an easy decision to make, considering Ms. Shires had worked with him before on Jason Isbell&#39;s albums Southeastern and Something More Than Free. Ms. Shires knew of Daves propensity toward arranging the songs in-studio, rather than rehearsing or making demos beforehand. Cobb believes in the spontaneity of early takes, and with the proficient rhythm section of Paul Slivka and Paul Griffith, the studio band was able to record the album in a relatively short amount of time without sacrificing performance quality. This approach gives each song on the album emotional urgency along with a groove thats loose and effortless. Among other things, Pale Fire is about consciously shifting ones own priorities. There are two types of lovers: the kind we need and the kind we want. The hard part is finding someone who represents both. You Are My Home is written as a gift, a token of appreciation to someone who has helped the narrator define her place in the world. Mineral Wells is a song Ms. Shires wrote many years ago, after relocating to Nashville from her childhood home in Texas. It speaks to the part of us that never really leaves that original homeplace. With My Piece Of Land, you get the sense that Amanda Shires has reached a personal pinnacle. This album is the creative milestone suited to accompany the recent milestones in her life: becoming a mother, developing into a true artist, and finally finding a home.",

		"description": " with Snacks<br> Iceage is Elias Bender Rnnenfelt, Dan Kjr Nielsen, Johan Suurballe Wieth, and Jakob Tvilling Pless. Beyondless, Iceages fourth record (and first that was recorded all-analog), was produced by the band and Nis Bysted, recorded by Mattias Glav at Kungsten Studios Gteberg, and mixed by Randall Dunn at Avast Studios Seattle. The album was played entirely by the band with additional performances by Nils Grndhal (violin), horns by Kasper Tranberg (trumpet), Lars Greve (saxophones) and Morten Jessen (trombone), and vocals on Pain Killer by Sky Ferreira.Below please find further words on this moving, majestic new album and its nuanced craftsmanship from Daniel Stewart (Total Control) and Richard Hell.-The beauty of a moral act depends on the beauty of its expression. To say that it is beautiful is to decide that it will be so. It remains to be proved so. This is the task of images, that is, of the correspondences with the physical world. The act is beautiful if it provokes, and in our throat reveals, song. Sometimes the consciousness with which we have pondered a reputedly vile act, the power of expression which must signify it, impels us to song. This means that treachery is beautiful if it makes us sing.-Genet, A Thiefs JournalBeyondless is the 4th LP from Iceage. This record radiates joy.Pay attention to the journey, from New Brigade, a juvenile delinquent take on post-punk, full of cold, distant condemnation, and onto the ecstasy of Youre Nothing, shedding the more aggressive hardcore influence and dragging in more light, a tendency followed on Plowing Into The Field Of Love. The intoxication is consistent, this has always been drunk music, but its less a stumbling confusion and more a sturdy heartfelt confession with each record. They have finally caught up with their ambition. Their entire charm has always rested in their running ahead of themselves with blind confidence, taunting you to follow and you follow because wherever they are going is vital, is alive; on Beyondless they are treading with an assurance that is disarming, but there is no loss of charm, you are arm in arm now, whispering intimacies.Intimacies that recall other intimacies: something must have happened when Iceage heard Gun Club Miami. Some traumatic event! A wild band has not been tamed, but is in repose, retaining an edge but expressing something less definite, something about hurt or longing or regret.Attention must be directed toward the brilliance of EBRs lyricism on Beyondless! In his evocations of beauty in profane imagery, in his plumbing of the depths of betrayal and criminality, there are suggestions of Jean Genet and the disgraceful slurring of Leonard Cohen.Loves Forever Changes is an appropriate reference point for the record, orchestral touches to rock music that reached in a very affected / effected manner toward some transcendent experience. You can hear blissful catatonic evocations of the Waterboys, slurring face down on the bar some holy affirmations. Overall, the strongest suggestion is of the Stones in their Exile period, holed up in some decadent mansion attempting to pay tribute to American music from country honk brawls to sleazy soul revues to cocaine blues, it has this confident air of music written in the midst of excessive reveries.Letting in the light, the joy radiates. They are post post-punk, Beyondless retains the rich character of their brash beginnings, but this is something beyond, oh hell, this is something very, very special, a generous gift for an anemic age.-Daniel Stewart (Total Control)-THE NEW ICEAGEby Richard HellI can totally imagine myself as a kid lying in my closed-door room in the dark, listening to this band and getting what I need, the way a band can make a person feel seen and bring confidence, sometimes even represent an ideal. Or maybe Im already all defiant and self-certain, and I identify with Iceage because they are too, and theyre who I want to represent me in music. Its a weird combination of qualities that a rock and roll band and their recordings presents to their young crowd, imparts to them. The music being pure emotion, the strong emotions of youthanger, sadness, contempt, longingas well as energy and sex, and the bands demonstration that it gracefully owns and provides those things, consoling their followers in all the confusion.What is it that Iceage in particular brings? A large number of extraordinary things. (Poetry! But more about that later.) The band members were childhood friends, which is always good news. Theyre like a small urban gang, faithful to each other, suspicious of outsiders (of which music journalists like me are the most suspect examples). At the same time, they seem mature and competent, which is almost too much to hope for. They not only play and compose well, but the production of their records, from the very beginning, and at the musics most chaotic, is impeccable. Their presentation is as hardcore anarchic as any, but much better played, mixed, and recorded than most.And then theres the poetry and the intelligence. The members of Iceage are not only smart but hyper literate. Interviews with E. Rnnenfelt, the lead singer and lyricist of the band, find him mentioning Carson McCullers, The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter; Georges Bataille, Story of the Eye; Peter Shaffers Equus; Mishima, The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea; Genets Thiefs Journal and Miracle of the Rose; The Torture Garden by Octave Mirbeau; Henry Miller on Writing; and James Agees A Death in the Family, and thats in a total of four interviews. Its not that he flaunts it; hes simply honest and naturally acknowledges it.The lyrics of Iceage songs have the most sophisticated vocabulary I can remember finding in rock music. Heres a favorite example, from Pain Killer (ft Sky Ferreira) on the new album:Praying at the altar of your legs and feetYour saliva is a drug so bittersweetIll arrogate whats there to takeIn an evanescent embraceArrogate??? I half know the word, but I had to look it up to be certain. It means to claim or seize without justification. Its funny because its Latin root also underlies the word arrogant, which one might be tempted to apply to Rnnenfelt for the contempt he shows for people who try to understand him. But I sympathize. It is extremely annoying to be characterized by other people. And the shading of meaning of the word arrogate brings a subtlety to those lyrics of his that take or seize or claim wouldnt. Frankly, though, what I really like about those lines is the concept of praying to his lovers feet. Thats good. It makes me think of a similar instance in another poet, Charles Baudelaire, who wrote in his Hymn to Beauty:Who cares if you come from paradise or hell,appalling Beauty, artless and monstrous scourge,if only your eyes, your smile or your foot revealthe infinite I love and have never known?",

		"description": " with Terra Lightfoot<br> Rock n roll has rarely been as smart, soulful or satisfying than it has in the hands of The Posies. During an on/off career thats stretched across four decades, the Seattle-rooted outfit, led by musical polymaths Jon Auer and Ken Stringfellow, have shaped and re-shaped their muse, creating one of the more compelling catalogues in modern pop.With SOLID STATES, their 8th album, the Posies mark dramatic changes in the lives, the music, the evolution of the band.When the Posies long time drummer, Darius, died suddenly and unexpectedly last year, Posies founding members Jon Auer and Ken Stringfellow were devastated. Hard as it was to continue without such a close friend and great musician, the moment called for a reinvention. For now the idea of the band getting into a room and banging out the music, garage band style, was over. The ideas coming from Jon and Ken were fragile and the moods contemplative. Death, divorce, loss. Even the joys of life are fleeting enough as to be treated with care and respect.Of course, the Posies still retain their legendary melodic abilities, their trademark vocal harmonies and their lyrical agility. The band has always been exploring, growing. The multiyear gaps between albums are typically spent in countless other projects that bring new skills, sounds, experiences and people to the picture. The band will present the album live in a new format, incorporating laptop elements along with guitars, keyboards and drums. As artists, the band feels its their duty to take risks and explore.",

Brandishing infectious melodies, arena-ready guitar riffs and driving rhythms, their sound is further distinguished by having two lead singers: Snipes and Alyssa Jewell (vocals, keys).<p>The Jewells met Snipes in 2015 when they saw him play at a local music festival. A conversation after the show led to instant chemistry over shared musical tastes. After over a year of playing shows together with their respective bands, B. Snipes and Crimson Cabins, they decided to form an epic rock band. After recruiting Kyle Blair (drums) and James McCauley (bass) the lineup was set and MRYGLD was born.<p> </p></p></p></p>",

Emma Ruth Rundle will be performing solo June 8th through 14th, Alexis Marshall (of the band Daughters) will be reading from his book as well as other poems June 9th through June 14th, and Null from Birmingham Alabama (members of Coliseum) will be performing June 15th through 21st. Looking forward.Young Widows&#39; bruising 2006 debut, Settle Down City, introduced the Louisville, KY trio as an ugly force to be reckoned with. Two years later they dropped Old Wounds, their sophomore stomp that inspired at least a dozen imitators of varying degrees of success. From there the band traded some of their trademark fury for the bleak, widescreen atmospheres of In and Out of Youth and Lightness. Now, three years later, Young Widows meld the strengths of their past and their tenacity for the future to forge Easy Pain, an album perfectly befitting their merciless moniker.",

		"description": " with Travis Meadows<br> In the lush tobacco fields of North Carolina where BJ Barham was raised, people work hard. Families stay nearby, toiling and growing together. BJ loves those farms and his tiny Reidsville hometown, but he had to run off and start American Aquarium, a band now beloved by thousands. BJ couldnt stay. But he couldnt really leave, either: hes still singing about the lessons, stories, and lives that define rural Americaand him.I moved to the big city to go to college and fell in love with music, BJ says. But half the songs on our record are about small townslittle pieces of my childhood. Ive had moments where it turns out a piece of broken English my father repeated twice a week is the most accurate way to say something. So I put it in a song.American Aquariums seventh studio album Things Change offers the bands finest collection of folk-infused Southern rock-and-roll to date. Stacked with BJs signature storytellingalways deeply personal but also instantly relatablethe record questions and curses current events, shares one mans intimate evolution, and leaves listeners with a priceless gift: hope. In my early 20s, I was not as hopeful, BJ says. Now, as Im getting ready to become a father, I think I have to be hopefulespecially with the situation our country is in now. For her sake, I have to be positive. He pauses. Her is his daughter, due in the spring of 2018. BJ adds, Being self-aware has always been a blessing and a curse. But thats whats always made my songwriting relatable to people. I dont hold back. Im almost too honest.BJs candor has fueled American Aquariums runaway appeal, visible most clearly in consistently sold-out shows across the country and throughout Europe - between 200 and 250 dates a year. Much has changed for the band and BJ since their acclaimed last effort, Wolves. In 2017, every American Aquarium member save BJ quit the group. American Aquarium has featured about 30 players since BJ founded the outfit in 2006, and while each member has left indelible marks, the band has always been anchored by the literary songs and sometimes roaring, sometimes whispering, drawl of BJ Barham. BJs personal life also underwent seismic shifts: He got sober. He got married. Soon, hell be a dad.Featuring a new band lineup that includes Shane Boeker on lead guitar, drummer Joey Bybee, bassist Ben Hussey, and Adam Kurtz on pedal steel and electric guitar, as well as a reinvigorated frontman in BJ, Things Change is American Aquariums first release on a label after selling thousands of records on their own. As an artist, your goal is for the newest thing you do to be better than the last. Youre slowly whittling away the bullshit to try and get to the truth, BJ says. With this album, I learned how to cut some of that fat so that its just truth. Its our best record.Recorded at 3CG Records in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Things Change was produced by Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter John Fulbright and features cameos from Americana standouts including John Moreland and Jamie Lin Wilson. Brazen album opener The World is on Fire is a richly layered rock-and-roll anthem that documents BJ and his wifes stunned reaction to the last presidential election. Emotional and conversational, the song taps into widespread feelings of confusion and fear: She said, What are we going to do? Whats this world coming to? / For the first time in my whole life, I stood there speechless. But what begins as despair builds into defiant faith, as BJ growls a call to action to cap off one of his favorite songs hes ever written. Im complaining about the state of things, and then the third verse almost serves as a challenge to myself: hey, youre in charge of another human being. You can create change, he says.Driving rock-and-roller Crooked + Straight explores the small-town consequences of questioning religion, and the tightness of family in the face of one members rejection. His fathers advice anchors the song. I come from a blue-collar family. Im the only one who didnt go into farming. I learned if you want something, you have to go out and take it. You cant expect anything from anybody, BJ says. You can only go out there and work harder. My dad always said you can outwork anybody else. Love for hard work and the people who carry it out appears repeatedly throughout Things Change. Guitar-heavy Tough Folks is a snarling ode to those with dirt under their fingernails, while bass- and pedal-steel-infused Work Conquers All spins a tale in praise and pursuit of Oklahomas state motto.The albums love songs are the kind of achingly beautiful that only comes with maturity and a willingness to expose ones own flaws. Haunting Shadows of You recalls a lovers flight as the protagonist longs for what he let get away. Gorgeous Till the Final Curtain Falls celebrates loyalty and pledges endless devotion. The moving title track takes an often doleful topicpeoples tendency to changeand turns it on its head, tracing BJs personal growth and recognizing his now-wifes steadfast love. BJs other two favorite tracks are album standouts. Moving When We Were Younger Men addresses the break-up of American Aquarium head on. As BJ professes love for his former bandmates over stripped down acoustic guitar, his voice is honeyed and deep. Its an open letter to five guys who I spent eight years of my life with seeing the entire world, BJ says. I think anyone who has ever had to walk away from a friendship or has had somebody walk away from them will relate to the song. Stunner One Day at a Time is self-perceptive and vulnerable, detailing BJs battles with himself. Even within his career full of well-written gems, the song is a towering accomplishment.At the end of the day, if youre not writing songs to affect other peoples lives, youre in it for the wrong reasons, BJ says, reflecting on the new album, where hes been, and where American Aquarium is headed. Money may come and go. You may never get fame. But if you sit down and write songs to affect people, you can do it your whole life and be happy.",

		"description": " <br> &quot;When was the last time you attended a live music performance with a genuine element of risk involved? And no, going to a Gwar show with a white t-shirt on doesn&#39;t count. When Bit Brigade takes the stage your mind will frantically oscillate between &quot;Oh! Agh!! Please don&#39;t die!!&quot; and &quot;YES! He&#39;s doing it!!&quot; Combining the dread and daring of a live video game speed run with the spot-on technique of a live band covering the musical accompaniment to everything you&#39;re seeing on-screen in real time, Bit Brigade will have you swinging between the two mediums. From thrashing about to live renditions of your favorite stage themes, fingers yearning to the sky in a rock &#39;n roll parody of sea anemones seeming to silently plead, &quot;Please, feed us more fretboard pyrotechnics!,&quot; to being locked in stock-still rapture as the infallible maestro of the d-pad, Noah McCarthy, takes on the final boss and risks his video game life under the threat of intense peer scorn (or the reward of night-long glory and a credits score). No matter the outcome, Bit Brigade must play on until the deed is done - which it always is - on the first (and last) try. Once Noahs NES buzzes on, there&#39;s no turning back.&quot; - Metalhead Mike of The Shizz, summer 2011",

		"description": " <br> Electronic Pop / Dream Pop from Milwaukee WIby Lizzy Goodman, Winter 2016The day after GGOOLLDD frontwoman Margaret Butler graduated from art school in Baton Rouge she packed a Uhaul and headed west. I was like, yeah, Im not going to live here anymore, she recalls, laughing. Her first stop was Portland, Oregon, where she subsisted mostly on ramen noodles and pumpkins people stole for me from Home Depot, she remembers. You saut them down and add lots of black pepper and curry powder and soy sauce. Its actually pretty good! Butler was riding high on that particular sense of freedom that comes when youve decided your life plan is to just say yes to pretty much everything. So you dont really care that youre broke and subsisting on stolen jack-o-lanterns, because youre not in your suburban high school anymore, hiding your disdain for the cheerleaders. Youre in a weird and cool new town, hanging out with musicians and designers and artists. Youre free to mess around. Explore. And just when youre starting to get a little over living four people deep, as Butler puts it, in your tiny apartment, another friend says, hey, come out to Wisconsin for a while. So you do. (Because: say yes!) And a while later, when, boozy in a bar one night, you hear some beats you think youd like to write lyrics to, even though youve never so much as held a microphone in your life, you go for it. (Say. Yes.) And the next thing you know, youre fronting a dynamic, dirty, synth-pop carnival of a band, hearing your single on the radio, and touring the country. Thats Margaret Butlers story. And thats the story of her band, a group as inspired by the shimmery decadence of Queen as they are by the primal yowl of Black Sabbath as they are by the madcap joy of Yeah Yeah Yeahs. GGOOLLDD is one of the most resolutely celebratory rock acts to emerge in years.Its not hard to understand how someone like Butler, a woman with seemingly limitless natural charisma and an obsession with dressing up in outrageous costumes (Halloween is her favorite holiday) would eventually find her way onstage, but the singer insists that rock stardom was never part of her plan. I never even considered being a musician, I always wanted to be a clothing designer, or a chef, she says. Ive always created with my hands. Butlers father is jeweler, and technically thats what she was studying to be as well. But she learned all her really important college-years lessons bartending at the Spanish Moon, a legendary venue in Baton Rouge. It was the only cool place to go and watch music in the city, she says. I got to see every amazing band as they were coming up, from TV On the Radio to Of Montreal to Dirty Projectors. Even though Butlers always loved music (shes an obsessive of the first order) aside from the one time she got really stoned and watched a John Bonham documentary then went right out and bought a pair of blue 1970s Ludwigs, she never tried to become a serious musician. I have great internal rhythm, Im just too A.D.D. to sit down and actually play, she says. I own eight different instruments and Ive gotten as far as like a week on each of them. But her culture, her people, her tribe has always been connected to music. The people she met in and around the Spanish Moon were the ones she moved to Portland with, and it was through that world that she wound up, one random early fall afternoon in 2013, recording vocals, in the foyer of her house in Milwaukee, to what would become GGOOLLDDs breakthrough debut single. It was the first song we ever wrote and it was called Gold, she recalls of the soulfully grimy track, on which bassist Nick Ziemann, guitarist Thomas Gilbert also played. (They added drummer Mark Stewart and synth player Nick Schubert soon after). We were like, Oh we need a name for the band - I guess it should be the same thing as the song title. A quick Google search revealed eight other bands named Gold, but they were all basically unsearchable because the word is so widely used, so we just decided to double letter it. Thinking nothing of it, they threw the song up on Bandcamp, planning to go back to their day jobs, but thats when the serendipity hurricane began. Somehow college radio picks it up, Butler recalls. And it starts getting really good responses. And then its on their list of top-ten-plays list, which is just insane. So they figured, why not keep this going for a while? We were like, this is fun! Lets write like three more songs, do a cover, and throw a party for Halloween where we can all wear gold costumes! The Halloween party is now the stuff of GGOOLLDD legend. I was Santigold, but instead of dressing up like the singer, I made an all gold Santa costume, Butler recalls, laughing. We played a terrible show to eight-some people crammed into our attic and it was one of the funnest nights ever! After that, people just kept asking us to play.Butler, who had by this time opened a vintage clothing business with her friends, initially thought of the band mostly as a good excuse to express her most playful sartorial impulses. We had our next show two weeks later so I made this weird tassled vinyl gold overlay on top of a crushed velvet gold romper, she remembers, but it wasnt long before they all realized this band had become more than an excuse to dress up. After that second show, CMJ picked up Gold, from the local Milwaukee radio station, 91.7, and from there, other college radio stations around the country began playing the track as well. The same un-mixed, un-mastered version they had made on Garage Band. After about a year I was like, people like this a lot better and they want to pay me a lot more than they do for vintage clothing, so I think Im just going to do this instead, Butler recalls. Its been three years and we have ten songs that are out right now, and were working on the next album. GGOOLLDD isnt like other bands. They formed on whim, decided to play their first show mostly as an excuse to host a killer party, and they eschew the traditional gotta-get-a-record-deal game in favor of playing a lot of shows and releasing their own material. That sense of whimsy blended with resolute autonomy is all part of the signature GGOOLLDD aesthetic. And it feeds into their sound, especially lately. Secrets, their new single, is a soaring banger that conjures wind-in-your-hair glittery romanticism. Co-produced and mixed by Ben H. Allen (MIA, Animal Collective) it reflects that core tension in GGOOLLDD between winging it and great artistry. Im not going to lie, Im great at writing a hook, Butler says, and is quick to point out that her bandmates are amazing, musicians. But if you ask me what I do, Im going to tell you that Im a performer before I tell you that Im a musician. She pauses and cracks up. Unless you dont know me at all, she continues. Then Im going to say Im a musician, because if I say Im a performer, youre going to automatically think that Im a stripper, which is totally ok too but not my current profession.",

		"description": " <br> Oneida has been a cornerstone of the Brooklyn underground for nearly two decades. Always evolving, the group has been a beacon of musical exploration and enthralling unpredictability, gaining legendary status among heads that know and expanding the limits of what it means to be a rock band. With a discography spanning over a dozen full-lengths, plus live releases, EPs, singles, and limited one-offs, Oneida has demonstrated a mastery of collective improvisation, off-kilter songwriting, complex composition, and everything in between. In 2011 Oneida lost its home base, its studio dubbed the Ocropolis in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, due to the pervasive gentrification and over-development of theneighborhood that was once a thriving arts community. After watching the Monster Island building that housed the Ocropolis transform into a pile of rubble, the band began an intense period of exploration and discovery, retreating from the studio in favor of the stage, and birthing a panoply of limited, uncompromising releases that documented the bands continuously unfolding journey. Six years after the release of A List of the Burning Mountains, the final emission from the Ocropolis, the band will release their newest studio creation Romance, their first album for Joyful Noise Recordings and a record marked by wild eclecticism, even for a group known for its shape-shifting nature. Recorded over several years in various locales, the 11 songs on Romance are built around deeply developed long-arc rhythm/phase concepts, noise, yearning, blind guitar rage, longing, the lurch of dying electronics, and a multi-modal embrace of human fallibility and artifice. From the crackling synth-led opener DzEconomy Traveldzto the expansive 18-minute epic DzShepherds Axe,dzRomance is an album in constant flux. On DzBad Habitdz the band employs phasing between organ and guitar to great, disorienting effect, while the primitive riffs of DzCockfightdz offer a contrasting vision of rock minimalism. Listen closely on DzLay of the Landdz and you will hear constant rhythmic development, with drummer Kid Millions eschewing repetition in favor of morphing patterns of hi-hat and snare. As with all mystery, Romance reveals more through closer attention and multiple listens. Oneida, always formidable in the live environment, will be touring throughout the year. Kid Millions remains one of the most in-demand drummers in New York,exploring the outer reaches of percussion music with his own Man Forever project, as well as playing with Laurie Anderson, Royal Trux, and People of the North with Oneida compatriot Bobby Matador. Bobby also takes part in the psych-pop duo Nurse & Soldier, and recently formed yet another duo called New Pope. Guitarist Shahin Moita is a co-founder of underground stalwarts Ex Models and Knyfe Hyts. Through it all Oneida remains a powerful collective voice, a propulsive force for wildness and excitement, with Romance heralding the return of the epic, artful ballad version of the journey.",

		"description": " <br> When Grizzly Bear came to the end of the road with their fourth album, 2012&#39;s &#39;Shields&#39;,the future was unclear. No dramatic decisions were made, no arguments were had, butthere was a feeling as there always is with the foursome that a breather was required.The band who emerged in 2004 in Brooklyn, New York, have forever functioned as aself-described democracy. It&#39;s equal and it&#39;s fair but it can also take a lot of out ofthem. And so they went their separate ways and bedded down in different corners.Vocalist and songwriter Ed Droste adapted back to life in Los Angeles, his new adoptedhome and decided to distance himself from music and the industry, vocalist, songwriter,and multi-instrumentalist Daniel Rossen moved to a remote area of upstate New Yorkand continued to write and record on his own, drummer, songwriter, and multiinstrumentalistChristopher Bear continued playing with various projects and worked onscoring a tv series, and vocalist, multi-instrumentalist, songwriter, and producer ChrisTaylor decided to go West to LA after a one year stint in Berlin. He produced for otherartists and made a solo record under the moniker CANT. Taylor, however, got restless.The band&#39;s mediator since the beginning, his feet started to itch after the usual sixmonths of downtime. I kinda kept writing everyone, he says. Telling them that weshould start making a record. I wanted to be making music with my band again. I stayedbusy, I wrote a cook book, produced other people, but my favorite thing to do was workwith my band. I was getting bored over here. He laughs. While all four members werestrewn across their various corners, he took it upon himself to start a cloud account essentially a dropbox. The intention was to allow the band a gentler entry point forstarting to think about coming together again. It was new for them, less pressurized, farmore relaxed and a guaranteed prevention measure against creative stalemate. Thedropbox was a home for inspiration, mood boards, ideas for music, demos, even songs.It was, however, quite a slow process, starting in March 2015. Painfully slow, chucklesTaylor. They did have one song &#39;Losing All Sense&#39; that made it to the record, butRossen was reticent to call this the beginning of something. The word &#39;album&#39; was aforbidden utterance at this point in time. We got into the water with one toe at a time toavoid freaking everyone out, recalls Taylor. Yeah this time around we came to itslowly, agrees Rossen. Tip-toeing towards a conversation.Chris Taylor started this motherfucker, adds Droste. I&#39;m so grateful to him because Idon&#39;t know whether it would have organically happened otherwise. Taylor even boughta guitar after five months of little progress and wrote in Big Sur. The song &#39;Sky TookHold&#39; got its start in one of those sessions. Taylor wrote the song &#39;Systole&#39; during histime in Berlin, and it is his first lead vocal for the band. I learned guitar so I could writesongs for the band, he says, as eager as he was then to be in conversation aboutGrizzly Bear. Once that catalyst came, there was still the question of whether or not itwas going to work. I&#39;m of the mindset that I never know if we&#39;ll make another album, nomatter how good or bad things are, says Droste. In a way it&#39;s a miracle this albumhappened because for a while it was to be decided. When it started to come togetherthere were a lot of ideas. Some didn&#39;t work. Eventually when things started to work wewere like, &#39;Oh my god it&#39;s happening.&#39;That relief, that momentum, that sense of a band really relishing the chance to relocatetheir mojo is apparent on the album, which wound up taking two years to make, viaremote writing trips taken variously by Taylor and Droste, and Bear and Rossen, then a retreat to Allaire Studios in New York in June 2016 once there was more of a cohesivecollection of songs. That&#39;s where they recorded a lot of 2009&#39;s &#39;Veckatimest&#39;. In additionto Allaire, they recorded in Vox Studios in Hollywood and at Taylor&#39;s LA studio in EchoPark. Rossen also continued to track parts for the record at his home upstate.It was so exciting when it was starting to work, says Droste. Perhaps what wasdifferent this time around was the communication barriers were set free. There was anakedness to receiving each other&#39;s ideas and a lack of tying expectations to particularresults. The whole affair was positively zen. I was coming at it like I have to be openwith everything, says Droste. Let&#39;s try anything and let it go. If it doesn&#39;t work, it doesn&#39;twork. Don&#39;t be precious or get upset when other bandmates don&#39;t like it. Keep trying.The resulting fifth Grizzly Bear album &#39;Painted Ruins&#39; benefits from having the songsdevelop in a completely organic way. We had a lot of fun making the record, saysRossen. Even though there are serious themes we tried to keep the sound as light aspossible. Maybe it&#39;s a matter of being a little older and not assuming that there should beso much wrapped up in what we were doing. That&#39;s what immediately bleeds forth whenyou listen through to the eleven tracks. Does it sound totally different? asks Droste,champing at the bit to get the juggernaut started again. More inviting?Indeed there&#39;s a deep warmth, a flirtatiousness to the sonic ideas, and a sense ofplayfulness that&#39;s perhaps the most surprising of all. It&#39;s a direct reflection of the joy theyexperienced while making it. It chimes with collective exhales, and the genuine love thatcame from reuniting with old friends. You forget that you have this great thing going onwith us, even though it can be really difficult, says Droste. When we finally got togetherit felt like there was a musical chemistry that was as real as it was when we were kids.That was thrilling in a way that was still the case, adds Rossen. You could almost saythat the band&#39;s propensity to chuck lots of ideas at the wall to see which ones stuck wasthe closest an established act can get to tapping into that energy that exists whilerecording a debut.For all four members the results of the sessions were unexpected. Droste points to&#39;Mourning Sound&#39; and closing track &#39;Sky Took Hold&#39;. That song was fleshed out in avery different way, then one day they added an ominous horn section that repeats and itchanged the whole thing for me, says Droste. That&#39;s what I love about working withthem. They just have ideas I would never have, and vice versa. It&#39;s a challenge to be in ademocratic band with strong opinions but I also thank god because we get all thesedifferent creative ideas that don&#39;t come naturally. It&#39;s very much four people. It alwayshas been. It always will for as long as we continue on. These are the three people whocontinually surprise me.Rossen came up with the title &#39;Painted Ruins&#39;. As usual, the band are more comfortableleaving the visuals, the lyrics, the themes to the listener&#39;s imagination, so you can takefrom their art what you will. I don&#39;t relate to a lot of explicit storytelling music, explainsDroste, before making up something on the spot. &#39;Her name was Jenny and she brokemy heart and then I went on a cruise&#39; Ok, don&#39;t know Jenny, haven&#39;t been on a cruise!Instead &#39;Painted Ruins&#39; has a different meaning to each member of the band. It&#39;s theidea of dressing up something that&#39;s falling apart and making something out of asituation that&#39;s crumbling, says Rossen. In a way that&#39;s how a lot of this music cametogether. Some of it was a pastiche and it found its way into a cohesive form.There&#39;s also clearly a connotation with the general breakdown that&#39;s happening in thewider world, which can also be mirrored in the band&#39;s lives as they reached their latethirties. We all were hoping to achieve a sense of personal decay or breakdownrepresenting a larger whole or situation, not necessarily writing topical music but writingpersonal music that could represent larger strife, adds Rossen. For Bear, the album isabout personal reflection. Observing yourself, he explains. Seeing how you&#39;reinteracting when you&#39;re going through change. It&#39;s not a breakup record or a socialcommentary record, there&#39;s a lot of sides to the human experience.&#39;Painted Ruins&#39; isn&#39;t a passing pleasure, it&#39;s a body of work intended to be lived in. Itspsychedelic grooves, challenging composition and pensive lyrics require repeated listensand develop significance, attachment and deep-rooted appreciation over time. That saidit strays from getting too intense or introspective. Some of the tracks take on a morepersonal bent. The likes of &#39;Wasted Acres&#39; and &#39;Neighbors&#39;, the former of which is aboutRossen&#39;s life in upstate New York. That tune started as a simple and direct lyric aboutcollecting firewood with my dog, says Rossen. &#39;Four Cypresses&#39;, on the other hand, withits refrain of it&#39;s chaos but it works is more political, though the band would prefer tokeep the overtones less explicit.Droste has been a staunch advocate for politics online via social media these past fewyears. The band recognize the importance of that but don&#39;t feel that it necessarily needsto be written into the music. As soon as the Election was over I thought about howvaluable it is to be able to connect with other people through music, says Rossen, who&#39;santicipating touring this record more than anything. It&#39;s even more valuable in thispolitical climate, where you can impart a sense of shared experience, compassion,empathy or just humanity. You look at the news every day and it feels overwhelming andtruly bleak, you feel like giving up. There&#39;s a huge value in the ability to make somethingthat connects with other people.Having met with so many accolades that would have been deemed unfathomable tothem in the early days, you wonder what Grizzly Bear set out to achieve with anotheralbum. They opened for Radiohead on their debut (a total mindfuck according toDroste). They played Radio City Music Hall on their last record &#39;Shields&#39;. Are there anytangibles they&#39;d love to chase? I&#39;d just like to reach new people, says Droste, simply. Iwant to grow. A lot of writing has to do with selfish reasons. Getting shit out of yoursystem, self-therapy. My favorite thing of all is the performing and the connection. ForRossen, it&#39;s all about the music. If we can continue working together and enjoy whatwe&#39;re making and feel that it&#39;s vital to us, if we can do that in a sustained way that&#39;sabout as much as I can hope for.Taylor, on the other hand, wears his heart firmly on his sleeve. I&#39;m excited that I&#39;mbetter friends with everyone in the band than ever, he says. Life is too short not toenjoy what youre doing. Were in a lucky situation.",

		"description": " <br> Five years have passed since Case&#39;s last solo project, The Worse Things Get, the Harder I Fight, the Harder I Fight, the More I Love You. In the interim, she sang on Whiteout Conditions, the 2017 release from longtime bandmates the New Pornographers. The year before that, she released a vinyl box set of her solo work and joined k.d. Lang and Laura Veirs on the case/lang/veirs project.Recording that record was a revelation, from Veirs&#39; innovative guitar tunings to Lang&#39;s skills in studio. &quot;I learned so much experiencing the work ethic of those two,&quot; Case says. She considers Lang &quot;probably the most natural producer I&#39;ve ever seen. Watching her work was awe-inspiring.&quot;After their national tour together, Case found similar transcendence in October 2016 sitting on a panel at the first-of-its-kind &quot;Woman Producer&quot; summit in Brooklyn, NY. Between discussions and performances from a diverse group of women who produce music from around the world, she wondered how it had taken such a long time to get to that moment, and why so many female pioneers had been forgotten.She felt lucky to have worked with the people she had encountered across her career-Darryl Neudorf, Tucker Martine, Craig Schumacher, and Chris Schultz among them-who encouraged her to expand her own skills in studio. But she had also gotten fed up with a world in which women&#39;s accomplishments seemed to vanish from public memory. &quot;The George Martins and Quincy Joneses of the recording pantheon deserve every drop of praise and every project they have received,&quot; Case says. &quot;But we can&#39;t keep telling the same stories over and over. We need more stories, more inspiration, more flavors.&quot;She set to work on her next record looking for not just new stories but also new sounds. This time, she wanted to put herself in a setting far away from everything she knew. She recalled Bjrn Yttling&#39;s skill with Lykke Li, Camera Obscura, and his own band, Peter Bjorn and John. &quot;I&#39;ve worked with the same people so long, I never had to step outside my comfort zone,&quot; Case says. &quot;In this instance, I chose to.&quot;The two met over breakfast in Washington, DC, and decided to team up. By the time she went to Sweden in the fall of 2017, Case had already written songs with longtime collaborator Paul Rigby, laid down vocal and guitar tracks at WaveLab Studio in Tucson, and built Carnacial Singing, her recording space in Vermont.But in the middle of her stint in Stockholm, with the finish line in sight, she received a surreal 3am call telling her that her house was burning and would likely be completely destroyed. She felt panicked and helpless.The fire had started in the barn, where she kept an assortment of belongings, from artwork to old pianos. A friend had managed to get the dogs to safety. After the flames jumped to the house, her home was engulfed, too.A few hours later, she went into a studio in Stockholm and laid down the vocals for &quot;Bad Luck,&quot; singing the lines she had written long before she realized they would land on her.Case is now stoic about the fire. &quot;If somebody burned your house down on purpose, you&#39;d feel so violated. But when nature burns your house down, you can&#39;t take it personally.&quot; The month before the blaze, Hurricane Harvey had slammed into Texas and flooded Houston. Her home burned just as Puerto Rico was plunged into a nightmare by Hurricane Maria and wildfires incinerated California. &quot;In the big picture, my house burning was so unimportant,&quot; she says. &quot;So many people lost so much more: lives and lives and lives.&quot;She was hell-bent on not losing sight of the goal, reminding herself there was still beauty in the world and in the process of making music. She had been reading a lot of ancient history, including Adrienne Mayor&#39;s The Amazons, and thinking about how for millennia, women have been more central to events than the average history class admits. &quot;We were always there, we were just erased. And I knew it. As a little girl I knew it. As a young person I knew it,&quot; Case says. &quot;Now I know it anew with a ferocious, righteous, razor-sharp tribe of witnesses, and it makes me feel like a super-powerful human being. It makes me feel joy. There&#39;s an inheritance there that&#39;s really important, and I want to share it.&quot;She decided to climb inside her role as producer and wield it more directly. It just meant owning what she was already doing.***The record that came out of this reckoning with lost stories delivers both familiar Neko Case and something different. Death, extinction, exploitation, tides, animals, and adoration all blend recognizably. Case&#39;s trademark narrative gaps, just large enough for listeners to enter each song, likewise remain. As with Fox Confessor Brings the Flood and Middle Cyclone, Hell-On spins away from conventions of story, slipping into real life, with its fierce mess and blind catastrophes.&quot;I&#39;m writing fairy tales, and I hear my life story in them, but they&#39;re not about me,&quot; Case says. &quot;I still can&#39;t figure out how to describe it. But I think that&#39;s why we make music or write things. You&#39;ve got to invent a new language.&quot;There are differences, too. The opening kalimba notes of the first track, &quot;Hell On,&quot; lead into a waltz of deep forces, irresistible as gravity, that refuse to be leashed or controlled (&quot;You&#39;ll not be my master / you&#39;re barely my guest&quot;). This tornado might not love you.Case planned this record with a commitment to big choruses and a goal of making them even bigger. The results appear in the anthemic &quot;Last Lion of Albion,&quot; a requiem for every landscape and iconic creature (&quot;last tiger of Tasmania / the last she-wolf to suckle Rome&quot;) erased through massacre and marketing. Rounding out the opening trilogy of false possession is &quot;Halls of Sarah,&quot; a song for unwilling muses tormented by poets who love women &quot;as lions love Christians.&quot;&quot;Bad Luck,&quot; recorded from the ground up in Stockholm, opens at a gallop and never breaks stride. A song always poses the challenge of when to move away from the groove and how to get back to it. But Yttling pointed out to Case that sometimes the whole song should be the hook-that there&#39;s no shame in exploiting the catchiest part. That became the strategy for bringing &quot;Bad Luck&quot; to life. Longtime collaborators Kelly Hogan and Nora O&#39;Connor came up with backing vocals that build a giddy, knowing call and response into the song.For &quot;The Curse of the I-5 Corridor,&quot; former Screaming Trees frontman Mark Lanegan duets with Case on a ballad of memory and departure. Melancholy grooves &quot;Gumball Blue&quot; and &quot;My Uncle&#39;s Navy&quot; mark Case&#39;s first songwriting efforts with New Pornographers cofounder Carl Newman. And after performing it live for years, Case has finally done a studio recording with Eric Bachmann of his song &quot;Sleep All Summer,&quot; which moved her to pull over to the side of the road and cry the first time she heard it on the radio.The labyrinthine &quot;Dirty Diamond&quot; opens onto room after room of shifting vocals that soar above a march-like rhythm. &quot;Oracle of the Maritimes,&quot; perhaps the most fairy tale song on the record, floats over a tuning invented by co-writer Laura Veirs, carrying a love that longs to prove itself (&quot;come on sweet girl let&#39;s find you an ocean / that goes with your eyes&quot;).Clouds of mosquitoes rising out of hot tires, a chest of drawers that rides out into the waves, a box filled with unnamed newborn creatures: these songs are bursting with images that can only be understood through peripheral vision, shards of imaginary lives wired into a mosaic.Later comes &quot;Winnie,&quot; a pirate love song for a woman with a mouth &quot;as sharp as the rib of a star.&quot; The song came from the afterglow of reading Amazons. &quot;There aren&#39;t enough songs that are obviously about a woman loving another woman, just loving her, Sapphic or Platonic,&quot; Case says. &quot;I thought there should be one, because I know I sit around loving them all day.&quot;The record ends with &quot;Pitch or Honey,&quot; winding its way through intimate verses sung over a drum machine before blooming into layered vocals, a bigger beat, and a wall of sound. &quot;Am I making pitch or honey?&quot; fades into repetition of &quot;I love you better when you&#39;re wild.&quot;The record was born at the hands of some three dozen performers in all, from k.d. Lang, Laura Veirs, Beth Ditto, and Robert Forster on backing vocals, to Joey Burns of Calexico and Doug Gillard of Guided by Voices on guitars, and Barbara Gruska and Matt Chamberlain on drums. The sidelong perspective is part of the known Neko galaxy, but the production is more expansive and edgier, moving into new universes. These are songs that can swallow you.***When Case returned to the US and walked through the ruins of her home, the fire that had blazed after these songs were written became part of the record. For the cover, she made a warrior&#39;s helmet out of cigarettes. Interior and exterior shots of her incinerated house appear on the gatefold and booklet. And a tiny pop-open charred Brothers-Grimm cottage serves as the set for the video of &quot;Bad Luck.&quot;It was as if nature invented a landscape for Hell-On after the fact: a melted ladder, seared insulation dangling in ribbons, the internal organs of pianos. She thought it should all be included in solidarity with those who had lost so much in the past year.All the living creatures present at the time of the fire were found alive, and so Case was able see beauty in the bleak scene. &quot;It felt like this out-of-time Jacques Cousteau undersea expedition through a sunken World War II ship. Of course there&#39;s some shit I miss,&quot; she says, citing family photographs and a favorite sweater. &quot;But none of it matters.&quot;And as for those fairy tales she&#39;s writing and the history she&#39;s remembering: &quot;We need them now more than ever. We need stories from all sectors. Stories without endings. Stories with multiple endings. Stories that don&#39;t end happily, cautionary tales, everything. We don&#39;t need Disneyfied stories anymore.&quot;A force of nature, an act of a mercurial, forgotten god, Hell-On is a record sealed by fire, filled with love and rage and dangers that might lay waste to everything at any moment. So if you wake up dazed in a smoking landscape, walking through the detritus of your own lost civilization with the smell of ash in your hair, your favorite sweater gone and a new song in your head, don&#39;t say you weren&#39;t warned.",

		"description": " with King Tuff, Presented by Birmingham Mountain Radio<br> Father John Misty is the brainchild of singer-songwriter Josh Tillman. Tillman has released three widely acclaimed albums Fear Fun (2012), I Love You, Honeybear (2015) and his most recent release, Pure Comedy, his Grammy-nominated album (2017). Father John Misty has also recently contributed to songs by Beyonc and Lady Gaga. As for his most recent album, Pure Comedyit is a complex, often-sardonic, and, equally often, touching meditation on the confounding folly of modern humanity. The album has earned Father John Misty placement on over &quot;50 Best of 2017&quot; lists from Entertainment Weekly, The Guardian, The Sunday Times, Rolling Stone, Stereogum, Pitchfork and more. The reception to Pure Comedy also led to a series of incredible performances with Saturday Night Live,Austin City Limits, the Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Tonight Showand Late Night with Seth Meyers. He recently completed a wildly successful tour in support of the Pure Comedy, and will release its follow up in 2018.",
